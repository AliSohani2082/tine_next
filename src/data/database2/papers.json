        "title": "Mechanical performance of recycled aggregate concrete in green civil engineering: Review",
        "abstract": "The use of recycled aggregate concrete can save natural resources and reduce environmental pollution, which has been widely concerned in recent years. The physical and mechanical properties of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) are studied based on the literature on waste concrete coarse aggregate (RCCA) and waste brick coarse aggregate (RBCA) published around the world in the last 40 years, in order to understand and study the performance of common RAC. The common characteristics (water absorption, density, and crushing value) of two recycled aggregates with the same particle size were compared. The effects of effective water–cement ratio (e–W/C), aggregate cement ratio (A/C), and recycled aggregate content on the compressive properties of recycled concrete are explained, and the microstructure of recycled concrete is explored. The influence of recycled aggregate content on its elastic modulus (Ec) and the correlation between Ec and the compressive strength of recycled concrete are also investigated. Finally, prospects were made for two types of RAC for further research by scholars. © 2023",

        "title": "The social cost of depression: Investigating the impact of impaired social emotion regulation, social cognition, and interpersonal behavior on social functioning",
        "abstract": "Depressive disorders are often accompanied by severe and pervasive impairments in social functioning, surpassing those experienced by individuals with other chronic medical conditions. Inability to effectively navigate social situations, establish and maintain healthy relationships lead to significant social stress and isolation. Social cognitive performance has been found to be inversely correlated with depression severity, while negative emotional biases persist even in remission. These social dysfunctions may arise from maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and difficulties interpreting emotional stimuli and mental states. Our article reviews the extensive evidence supporting the notion that depression is primarily a social disorder, examining impairments in self-focused social cognition, other-focused social cognition, and interpersonal behavior. By demonstrating how deficits in these domains result in diminished social functioning, increased stress, and reduced quality of relationships, we underscore the importance of recognizing and addressing the social impact of depression. © 2023 The Author(s)",

        "title": "Self-optimization wavelet-learning method for predicting nonlinear thermal conductivity of highly heterogeneous materials with randomly hierarchical configurations",
        "abstract": "In the present work, we propose a self-optimization wavelet-learning method (SO-W-LM) with high accuracy and efficiency to compute the equivalent nonlinear thermal conductivity of highly heterogeneous materials with randomly hierarchical configurations. The randomly structural heterogeneity, temperature-dependent nonlinearity and material property uncertainty of heterogeneous materials are considered within the proposed self-optimization wavelet-learning framework. Firstly, meso- and micro-structural modeling of random heterogeneous materials are achieved by the proposed computer representation method, whose simulated hierarchical configurations have relatively high volume ratio of material inclusions. Moreover, temperature-dependent nonlinearity and material property uncertainties of random heterogeneous materials are modeled by a polynomial nonlinear model and Weibull probabilistic model, which can closely resemble actual material properties of heterogeneous materials. Secondly, an innovative stochastic three-scale homogenized method (STSHM) is developed to compute the macroscopic nonlinear thermal conductivity of random heterogeneous materials. Background meshing and filling techniques are devised to extract geometry and material features of random heterogeneous materials for establishing material databases. Thirdly, high-dimensional and highly nonlinear material features of material databases are preprocessed and reduced by wavelet decomposition technique. The neural networks are further employed to excavate the predictive models from dimension-reduced low-dimensional data. At the same time, advanced intelligent optimization algorithms are utilized to self-search the optimal network structure and learning rate for obtaining the optimal predictive models. Finally, the computational accuracy and efficiency of the presented approach are validated via various numerical experiments on realistic random composites. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for detecting cyber-attacks in cyber-physical systems using a monitor. The method employs an abstract model called Tiny Twin, which is built at design time and is used at runtime to detect inconsistencies. Tiny Twin is a state transition system that represents the observable behavior of the system from the monitor point of view. We model the behavior of the system in the Rebeca modeling language and use Afra model checker to generate the state space. The Tiny Twin is built automatically, by abstracting the state space while keeping the observable actions and preserving the trace equivalence. For doing that we had to solve the complexities in the state space introduced by time-shifts, nondeterministic assignments and abstraction of internal actions. We formally define the state space as Concise Rebeca Timed Transition System (CRTTS), and then map CRTTS to an LTS. The LTS is then fed to a tool to abstract away the non-observable actions. © 2023 The Author(s)",

        "title": "Multiclass autoencoder-based active learning for sensor-based human activity recognition",
        "abstract": "Leveraging the enormous amounts of real-world data collected through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, human activity recognition (HAR) has become a crucial component of numerous human-centric applications, with the aim of enhancing the quality of human life. While the recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved HAR, the process of labeling data continues to remain a significant challenge due to the substantial costs associated with human annotation for supervised model training. Active learning (AL) addresses this issue by strategically selecting informative samples for labeling during model training, thereby enhancing model performance. Although numerous approaches have been proposed for sample selection, which consider aspects of uncertainty and representation, the difficulties in estimating uncertainty and exploiting distribution of high-dimensional data still pose a major issue. Our proposed deep learning-based active learning algorithm, called Multiclass Autoencoder-based Active Learning (MAAL), learns latent representation leveraging the capacity of Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD). With the multiclass autoencoder which learns the normal characteristics of each activity class in the latent space, MAAL provides an informative sample selection for model training by establishing a link between the HAR model and the selection model. We evaluate our proposed MAAL using two publicly available datasets. The performance results demonstrate the improvements across the overall active learning rounds, achieving enhancements up to 3.23% accuracy and 3.67% in the F1 score. Furthermore, numerical results and analysis of sample selection are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MAAL compared to the alternative comparison methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "The strength of marine economic resilience (MER) determines whether a region can maintain its original development path or fall into stagnation in the face of economic shock, which is an important starting point for promoting marine economic sustainable development. We discuss the connotation and propose a logical framework for MER, which is estimated by CRITIC-TOPSIS method from 2006 to 2019 based on three dimensions (country, region, province). Furthermore, the temporal evolution trend and regional disparities are accessed by Dagum Gini coefficient. Results reveal that MER has shown a significant upward trend, and it is undergoing gradient change in China, and unfortunately, the specific performance is in the imbalance, and lack of coordination of MER in the southern marine economic circle is the most prominent. Foreseeably, the novel fractional nonlinear grey model with double optimization (DOFNGBM(1,1)) combining Grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is proposed and its performance is examined. Ulteriorly, as predicted by DOFNGBM(1,1) and presented by σ convergence and β convergence models, based on the cross-comparison between in-sample and out-of-sample, significant findings indicate that weak convergence of China's MER indicates that coastal areas with a low level have faster improvement rates, and MER in China will present different ways of growing delightedly. Comparatively, considering the driving factors of marine economic resilience, all of them are proven to be conducive to raising the steady-state value of MER to a higher level, despite the regional heterogeneity of their effects. Purposefully, it implies that diversified development and synergistic cooperation can improve the endogenous power of marine economic resilience. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "Faking on personality tests continues to be a challenge in hiring practices, and with the increased accessibility to free, generative AI large language models (LLM), the difference between human and algorithmic responses is difficult to distinguish. Four LLMs–GPT-3.5, Jasper, Google Bard, and GPT-4 were prompted to provide ideal responses to personality measures, specific to a provided job description. Responses collected from the LLM's were compared to a previously collected student population sample who were also directed to respond in a ideal fashion to the same job description. Overall, score comparisons indicate the superior performance of GPT-4 on both the single stimulus and forced-choice personality assessments and reinforce the need to consider more advanced options in preventing faking on personality assessments. Additionally, results from this study indicate the need for future research, especially as generative AI improves and becomes more accessible to a range of candidates. © 2023",

        "title": "Demonstrating the successful application of synthetic learning in spine surgery for training multi–center models with increased patient privacy",
        "abstract": "From real–time tumor classification to operative outcome prediction, applications of machine learning to neurosurgery are powerful. However, the translation of many of these applications are restricted by the lack of “big data” in neurosurgery. Important restrictions in patient privacy and sharing of imaging data reduce the diversity of the datasets used to train resulting models and therefore limit generalizability. Synthetic learning is a recent development in machine learning that generates synthetic data from real data and uses the synthetic data to train downstream models while preserving patient privacy. Such an approach has yet to be successfully demonstrated in the spine surgery domain. Spine radiographs were collected from the VinDR–SpineXR dataset, with 1470 labeled as abnormal and 2303 labeled as normal. A conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) was trained on the radiographs to generate a spine radiograph and normal/abnormal label. A modified conditional GAN (SpineGAN) was trained on the same task. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using the real data to label abnormal radiographs. A CNN was trained to label abnormal radiographs using synthetic images from the GAN and in a separate experiment from SpineGAN. Using the real radiographs, an AUC of 0.856 was achieved in abnormality classification. Training on synthetic data generated by the standard GAN (AUC of 0.814) and synthetic data generated by our SpineGAN (AUC of 0.830) resulted in similar classifier performance. SpineGAN generated images with higher FID and lower precision scores, but with higher recall and increased performance when used for synthetic learning. The successful application of synthetic learning was demonstrated in the spine surgery domain for the classification of spine radiographs as abnormal or normal. A modified domain–relevant GAN is introduced for the generation of spine images, evidencing the importance of domain–relevant generation techniques in synthetic learning. Synthetic learning can allow neurosurgery to use larger and more diverse patient imaging sets to train more generalizable algorithms with greater patient privacy. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "With one exception, the only known hemiurid trematodes that do not use teleost fishes as definitive hosts instead occur in marine elapid snakes. These comprise six species across four genera and three subfamilies, and so presumably indicate at least three independent invasions of marine snakes from teleost fishes. Here, one of these taxa, Tubulovesicula laticaudi Parukhin, 1969 (= T. orientalis Chattopadhyaya, 1970 n. syn.) is reported from Sri Lanka, collected from Shaw's sea snake Hydrophis curtus (Shaw) (Elapidae: Hydrophiinae: Hydrophinii), the annulated sea snake H. cyanocinctus Daudin and the yellow sea snake H. spiralis (Shaw) off Nayaru in the Bay of Bengal, and from H. spiralis in Portugal Bay, Gulf of Mannar. Novel molecular data, for COI mtDNA and ITS2 and 28S rDNA, are the first for a species of Tubulovesicula Yamaguti, 1934. Nominally, Tubulovesicula belongs in the Dinurinae Looss, 1907, but in phylogenetic analyses based on 28S rDNA, our sequences for T. laticaudi resolved relatively distant from that for representatives of Dinurus Looss, 1907, the type-genus, rendering the subfamily polyphyletic. Tubulovesicula laticaudi resolved closest to data for the type-species of the Plerurinae Gibson & Bray, 1979, but that subfamily is also polyphyletic. These findings lead us to re-evaluate an alternative classification considered by Gibson & Bray (1979). We propose restricting the Dinurinae for forms with a permanent sinus-organ (Dinurus, Ectenurus Looss, 1907; Erilepturus Woolcock, 1935; Paradinurus Vigueras, 1958; Qadriana Bilqees, 1971) and resurrect the Mecoderinae Skrjabin & Guschanskaja, 1954 for forms with a temporary sinus-organ (Mecoderus Manter, 1940, Allostomachicola Yamaguti, 1958, Stomachicola Yamaguti, 1934 and Tubulovesicula). © 2023 The Author(s)",

        "abstract": "Background: Variation of inferior vena cava (IVC) is used to predict fluid-responsiveness, but the IVC visualization with standard sagittal approach (SC, subcostal) cannot be always achieved. In such cases, coronal trans-hepatic (TH) window may offer an alternative, but the interchangeability of IVC measurements in SC and TH is not fully established. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) with automated border detection may be of clinical value but it needs validation. Methods: Prospective observational validation study in mechanically ventilated patients with pressure-controlled mode. Primary outcome was the IVC distensibility (IVC-DI) in SC and TH imaging, with measurements taken both in M-Mode or with AI software. We calculated mean bias, limits of agreement (LoA), and intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficient. Results: Thirty-three patients were included. Feasibility rate was 87.9% and 81.8% for SC and TH visualization, respectively. Comparing imaging from the same anatomical site acquired with different modalities (M-Mode vs AI), we found the following IVC-DI differences: (1) SC: mean bias − 3.1%, LoA [− 20.1; 13.9], ICC = 0.65; (2) TH: mean bias − 2.0%, LoA [− 19.3; 15.4], ICC = 0.65. When comparing the results obtained from the same modality but from different sites (SC vs TH), IVC-DI differences were: (3) M-Mode: mean bias 1.1%, LoA [− 6.9; 9.1], ICC = 0.54; (4) AI: mean bias 2.0%, LoA [− 25.7; 29.7], ICC = 0.32. Conclusions: In patients mechanically ventilated, AI software shows good accuracy (modest overestimation) and moderate correlation as compared to M-mode assessment of IVC-DI, both for SC and TH windows. However, precision seems suboptimal with wide LoA. The comparison of M-Mode or AI between different sites yields similar results but with weaker correlation.

        "abstract": "In recent years, some researchers have put forth the compactness hypothesis, which suggests that similar colours tend to accumulate in the salient region as opposed to the non-salient region in image saliency detection. We discovered that the k-nearest neighbour (kNN) mechanism assumes the presence of similar objects in close proximity. As the kNN method is a supervised learning approach, we introduced an unfixed k value and combined it with the clustering idea of k-means to develop a novel algorithm called kNN clustering. We proposed an object-biased prior and an improved boundary and background prior based on a given compact matrix. Our algorithm was extensively tested on five publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that it outperformed eight existing top unsupervised models in producing high-quality saliency maps at full resolution. The improved prior methods were particularly effective when employed with existing algorithms lacking prior knowledge, especially with low-performing models. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous exploration is a critical technology to realize robotic intelligence as it allows unsupervised preparation for future tasks and facilitates flexible deployment. In this paper, a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based autonomous exploration strategy is proposed to efficiently reduce the unknown area of the workspace and provide accurate 2D map construction for mobile robots. Different from existing human-designed exploration techniques that usually make strong assumptions about the scenarios and the tasks, we utilize a model-free method to directly learn an exploration strategy through trial-and-error interactions with complex environments. To be specific, the Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD) is first utilized for domain conversion to obtain a high-dimensional Topological Environmental Representation (TER). Then, the Generalized Voronoi Networks (GVN) with spatial awareness and episodic memory is designed to learn autonomous exploration policies interactively online. For complete and efficient exploration, Invalid Action Masking (IAM) is employed to reshape the configuration space of exploration tasks to cope with the explosion of action space and observation space caused by the expansion of the exploration range. Furthermore, a well-designed reward function is leveraged to guide the learning of policies. Extensive baseline tests and comparative simulations show that our strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art strategies in terms of map quality and exploration speed. Sufficient ablation studies and mobile robot experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our strategy. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of medical images is a necessary prerequisite for diagnosing related diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive method in clinical practice, but obtaining reliable labeled training data for deep learning models is time-consuming and challenging. In this study, we propose an adaptive feature aggregation-based multi-task learning for uncertainty-guided semi-supervised image segmentation, dubbed AFAM-Net. The framework leverages a reconstruction task to capture anatomical information from raw images and assist the segmentation task. Moreover, we propose an adaptive feature aggregation strategy that selectively transfers useful features while filtering out irrelevant information, considering the associations between the two tasks. To better utilize unlabeled data, we incorporate dual uncertainty-aware methods to improve the segmentation performance. We evaluate the proposed AFAM-Net on clinical liver, 3D heart, and Cine cardiac MRI datasets. According to the experimental results, our AFAM-Net significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation algorithms. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

        "title": "Electrocardiogram-based deep learning algorithm for the screening of obstructive coronary artery disease",
        "abstract": "Background: Information on electrocardiogram (ECG) has not been quantified in obstructive coronary artery disease (ObCAD), despite the deep learning (DL) algorithm being proposed as an effective diagnostic tool for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Therefore, this study adopted a DL algorithm to suggest the screening of ObCAD from ECG. Methods: ECG voltage-time traces within a week from coronary angiography (CAG) were extracted for the patients who received CAG for suspected CAD in a single tertiary hospital from 2008 to 2020. After separating the AMI group, those were classified into ObCAD and non-ObCAD groups based on the CAG results. A DL-based model adopting ResNet was built to extract information from ECG data in the patients with ObCAD relative to those with non-ObCAD, and compared the performance with AMI. Moreover, subgroup analysis was conducted using ECG patterns of computer-assisted ECG interpretation. Results: The DL model demonstrated modest performance in suggesting the probability of ObCAD but excellent performance in detecting AMI. The AUC of the ObCAD model adopting 1D ResNet was 0.693 and 0.923 in detecting AMI. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score of the DL model for screening ObCAD were 0.638, 0.639, 0.636, and 0.634, respectively, while the figures were up to 0.885, 0.769, 0.921, and 0.758 for detecting AMI, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that the difference between normal and abnormal/borderline ECG groups was not notable. Conclusions: ECG-based DL model showed fair performance for assessing ObCAD and it may serve as an adjunct to the pre-test probability in patients with suspected ObCAD during the initial evaluation. With further refinement and evaluation, ECG coupled with the DL algorithm may provide potential front-line screening support in the resource-intensive diagnostic pathways. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Here, we have developed a deep learning method to fully automatically detect and quantify six main clinically relevant atrophic features associated with macular atrophy (MA) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The development of MA in patients with AMD results in irreversible blindness, and there is currently no effective method of early diagnosis of this condition, despite the recent development of unique treatments. Using OCT dataset of a total of 2211 B-scans from 45 volumetric scans of 8 patients, a convolutional neural network using one-against-all strategy was trained to present all six atrophic features followed by a validation to evaluate the performance of the models. The model predictive performance has achieved a mean dice similarity coefficient score of 0.706 ± 0.039, a mean Precision score of 0.834 ± 0.048, and a mean Sensitivity score of 0.615 ± 0.051. These results show the unique potential of using artificially intelligence-aided methods for early detection and identification of the progression of MA in wet AMD, which can further support and assist clinical decisions. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new model to study carbon emission issues in seven emerging (E7) economies (China, Mexico, Turkey, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia and India). It employs weighted Quantum Spherical fuzzy DEMATEL model with golden cut using 18 years data, which was ranked for carbon emission evaluation via Quantum Spherical fuzzy TOPSIS method. The data includes macroeconomic variables for the period from 2003 to 2020. Paper observes that (i) CO2 emissions from fossil fuels is the most significant factor distressing the carbon emission problem of E7 economies. It suggests that these countries need to explore alternatives to fossil fuels to handle the carbon emission problem. (ii) The CO2 emission problem in energy production can be minimized by renewable energy and nuclear energy, suggesting some financial incentives to the investors in energy explorations areas. (iii) It is also observed that due to high volatility of CO2 emissions, a negative market factor exists in consumer sentiment in consumption of oil and petroleum products. This can be compensated via energy consumption fiscal policy in taxation and encourage of extractive industries and producers of petroleum products, as well as the uneven spatial development to have a significant impact on the reduction of CO2 emission. The paper gives recommendation that E7 countries need to find alternatives to fossil fuels in order to deal effectively with the carbon emission problem. © 2023 The Author(s)",

        "title": "Supervised deep learning with vision transformer predicts delirium using limited lead EEG",
        "abstract": "As many as 80% of critically ill patients develop delirium increasing the need for institutionalization and higher morbidity and mortality. Clinicians detect less than 40% of delirium when using a validated screening tool. EEG is the criterion standard but is resource intensive thus not feasible for widespread delirium monitoring. This study evaluated the use of limited-lead rapid-response EEG and supervised deep learning methods with vision transformer to predict delirium. This proof-of-concept study used a prospective design to evaluate use of supervised deep learning with vision transformer and a rapid-response EEG device for predicting delirium in mechanically ventilated critically ill older adults. Fifteen different models were analyzed. Using all available data, the vision transformer models provided 99.9%+ training and 97% testing accuracy across models. Vision transformer with rapid-response EEG is capable of predicting delirium. Such monitoring is feasible in critically ill older adults. Therefore, this method has strong potential for improving the accuracy of delirium detection, providing greater opportunity for individualized interventions. Such an approach may shorten hospital length of stay, increase discharge to home, decrease mortality, and reduce the financial burden associated with delirium. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "title": "An efficient quantum partial differential equation solver with chebyshev points",
        "abstract": "Differential equations are the foundation of mathematical models representing the universe’s physics. Hence, it is significant to solve partial and ordinary differential equations, such as Navier–Stokes, heat transfer, convection–diffusion, and wave equations, to model, calculate and simulate the underlying complex physical processes. However, it is challenging to solve coupled nonlinear high dimensional partial differential equations in classical computers because of the vast amount of required resources and time. Quantum computation is one of the most promising methods that enable simulations of more complex problems. One solver developed for quantum computers is the quantum partial differential equation (PDE) solver, which uses the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm (QAEA). This paper proposes an efficient implementation of the QAEA by utilizing Chebyshev points for numerical integration to design robust quantum PDE solvers. A generic ordinary differential equation, a heat equation, and a convection–diffusion equation are solved. The solutions are compared with the available data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We show that the proposed implementation provides a two-order accuracy increase with a significant reduction in solution time. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Unravelling protein distributions within individual cells is vital to understanding their function and state and indispensable to developing new treatments. Here we present the Hybrid subCellular Protein Localiser (HCPL), which learns from weakly labelled data to robustly localise single-cell subcellular protein patterns. It comprises innovative DNN architectures exploiting wavelet filters and learnt parametric activations that successfully tackle drastic cell variability. HCPL features correlation-based ensembling of novel architectures that boosts performance and aids generalisation. Large-scale data annotation is made feasible by our AI-trains-AI approach, which determines the visual integrity of cells and emphasises reliable labels for efficient training. In the Human Protein Atlas context, we demonstrate that HCPL is best performing in the single-cell classification of protein localisation patterns. To better understand the inner workings of HCPL and assess its biological relevance, we analyse the contributions of each system component and dissect the emergent features from which the localisation predictions are derived. © 2023, The Author(s).",

The comparison between the conventional slit-lamp microscope and LAS by an experienced ophthalmologist. Moreover, we also invited an ophthalmic postgraduate student and an undergraduate student with no clinical experience to assess TFBUT in those videos. The inter-observer reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Results: The TFBUT of 116 eyes in total was recorded. Reliability indexes were adequate. The Spearman’s correlation analysis and the intraclass correlation coefficient suggested a strong correlation between the 2 modalities (Right eye: Spearman’s r = 0.929, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.847–0.963, ICC = 0.978, p < 0.001; Left eye: Spearman’s r = 0.931, 95% CI = 0.866–0.964, ICC = 0.985, p < 0.001;). Between instruments, the majority of TFBUT measurements showed good agreement on Bland Altman plot. A high concordance was observed in TFBUT, when assessed by an ophthalmologist and an ophthalmic postgraduate student (Left eye: LAS ICC = 0.951, p < 0.001; Left eye: slit-lamp microscope ICC = 0.944, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Compared with the conventional slit-lamp microscope, the LAS has sufficient validity for evaluating TFBUT in clinics or at home. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Recently proposed state-of-the-art saliency detection models rely heavily on labeled datasets and rarely focus on perfect RGBD feature fusion, which lowers their generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a depth-based interaction and refinement network (DIR-Net) to fully leverage the depth information provided with RGB images to generate and refine the corresponding saliency segmentation maps. In total, three modules are included in our framework. A depth-based refinement module (DRM) and an RGB module work in parallel while coordinating via interactive spatial guidance modules (ISGMs), which utilize spatial and channel attention computed from both depth features and RGB features. In each layer, the features in both modules are refined and guided by the spatial information obtained from the other module through ISGMs. In the RGB module, before sending the depth-guided feature map to the decoder, a convolutional gated recurrent unit (ConvGRU)-based block is introduced to handle temporal information. Thinking about the clear movement information in RGB features, the block also guides temporal information in DRM. By merging the results from both the DRM and RGB modules, a segmentation map with distinct boundaries is generated. Considering the lack of depth images in popular public datasets, we utilize a depth estimation network that incorporates manual postprocessing-based correction to generate depth images on the DAVIS and UVSD datasets. The state-of-the-art performance achieved on both the original and new datasets illustrates the advantage of our RGBD feature fusion strategy, with a real-time speed of 19 fps on a single GPU. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Flexible pressure sensor plays a crucial role in wearable devices since it converts the physical signals of human motions into electrical signals. Among various pressure sensors, foam-based pressure sensors received great attention due to their excellent flexibility, low weight, and pressure resistance. However, the sensitivity of the foam-based pressure sensor is still not large enough, and the sensing range is also urged to be further improved. Herein, we proposed a high-performance foam-based pressure sensor composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), and nanofibers (FIBER). The PDMS/FIBER@MWCNT foam-based pressure sensor possessed outstanding sensitivity up to 4.07 kPa− 1 and a wide sensing range of 0–70 kPa. The pressure sensor also presented excellent linearity during 0–20 kPa and 20–70 kPa, respectively. And 2000 cyclic compression tests shown good cyclic stability. Meanwhile, the pressure sensor worked efficiently in monitoring subtle and large human motions, such as finger bending, wrist bending, throat vocal signals, and various pressures. In addition, the pressure sensor owned significant discrimination and high efficiency against different pressure, which is beneficial in human complex motion monitoring and signal analysis of wearable devices. Consequently, the PDMS/FIBER@MWCNT foam-based pressure sensor may possess promising prospects and potential in the applications of artificial electrical skin and wearable devices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

        "title": "Loss of neuron network coherence induced by virus-infected astrocytes: a model study",
        "abstract": "Coherent activations of brain neuron networks underlie many physiological functions associated with various behavioral states. These synchronous fluctuations in the electrical activity of the brain are also referred to as brain rhythms. At the cellular level, rhythmicity can be induced by various mechanisms of intrinsic oscillations in neurons or the network circulation of excitation between synaptically coupled neurons. One specific mechanism concerns the activity of brain astrocytes that accompany neurons and can coherently modulate synaptic contacts of neighboring neurons, synchronizing their activity. Recent studies have shown that coronavirus infection (Covid-19), which enters the central nervous system and infects astrocytes, can cause various metabolic disorders. Specifically, Covid-19 can depress the synthesis of astrocytic glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid. It is also known that in the post-Covid state, patients may suffer from symptoms of anxiety and impaired cognitive functions. We propose a mathematical model of a spiking neuron network accompanied by astrocytes capable of generating quasi-synchronous rhythmic bursting discharges. The model predicts that if the release of glutamate is depressed, normal burst rhythmicity will suffer dramatically. Interestingly, in some cases, the failure of network coherence may be intermittent, with intervals of normal rhythmicity, or the synchronization can disappear. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "title": "Medical device regulation (MDR) in health technology enterprises – perspectives of managers and regulatory professionals",
        "abstract": "Background: In the European Union (EU), there are over half a million medical devices, varying from pacemakers to software. Medical devices play an important role in health care as they are used in diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment, or to alleviate disease. Medical devices are regulated in the EU by the Medical Device Regulation (MDR), which came into force on 25 April 2017 and into application on 26 May 2021. The demand for regulation arose from the need to establish a transparent, robust, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework. This study aims to examine how the managers and regulatory professionals in health technology enterprises perceived the application of the MDR and what were their information needs regarding the MDR. Methods: A link to an online questionnaire was sent to 405 managers and regulatory professionals representing health technology enterprises in Finland. The study included 74 respondents. Descriptive statistics were used to describe and summarise the characteristics of the dataset. Results: Information related to the MDR was fragmented and the necessary information was sought from multiple information sources, while the Finnish Medicines Agency (Fimea) was regarded as the most important source of information and training provider. To some extent, the managers and regulatory professionals expressed their dissatisfaction with the performance of Fimea. The managers and regulatory professionals were not very familiar with the ICT systems provided by the EU. The size of an enterprise affected how many medical devices it manufactures and generally affected the views about the MDR. Conclusions: The managers and regulatory professionals understood the role of the MDR regarding the safety and transparency of medical devices. The available information regarding the MDR did not properly fit the needs of users and there seemed to be a gap in information quality. The managers and regulatory professionals had some difficulties understanding the available information. Based on our findings, we believe it is paramount to evaluate the challenges faced by Fimea and how it could improve its performance. To some extent, the MDR is regarded as a burden for smaller enterprises. It is important to highlight the benefits of ICT systems and to develop them to better meet the information needs of enterprises. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is closely linked to cognitive decline and alterations in brain structure and function. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is used to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases, such as cognitive impairment (CI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD). However, whether the functional connectivity (FC) of patients with T2DM and mild cognitive impairment (T2DM-MCI) is conducive to early diagnosis remains unclear. To answer this question, we analyzed the rs-fMRI data of 37 patients with T2DM and mild cognitive impairment (T2DM-MCI), 93 patients with T2DM but no cognitive impairment (T2DM-NCI), and 69 normal controls (NC). We achieved an accuracy of 87.91% in T2DM-MCI versus T2DM-NCI classification and 80% in T2DM-NCI versus NC classification using the XGBoost model. The thalamus, angular, caudate nucleus, and paracentral lobule contributed most to the classification outcome. Our findings provide valuable knowledge to classify and predict T2DM-related CI, can help with early clinical diagnosis of T2DM-MCI, and provide a basis for future studies. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for time-lapse 3D cell analysis. Specifically, we consider the problem of accurately localizing and quantitatively analyzing sub-cellular features, and for tracking individual cells from time-lapse 3D confocal cell image stacks. The heterogeneity of cells and the volume of multi-dimensional images presents a major challenge for fully automated analysis of morphogenesis and development of cells. This paper is motivated by the pavement cell growth process, and building a quantitative morphogenesis model. We propose a deep feature based segmentation method to accurately detect and label each cell region. An adjacency graph based method is used to extract sub-cellular features of the segmented cells. Finally, the robust graph based tracking algorithm using multiple cell features is proposed for associating cells at different time instances. We also demonstrate the generality of our tracking method on C. elegans fluorescent nuclei imagery. Extensive experiment results are provided and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. The code is available on GitHub and the method is available as a service through the BisQue portal. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Striatal projection neurons (SPNs), which progressively degenerate in human patients with Huntington’s disease (HD), are classified along two axes: the canonical direct-indirect pathway division and the striosome-matrix compartmentation. It is well established that the indirect-pathway SPNs are susceptible to neurodegeneration and transcriptomic disturbances, but less is known about how the striosome-matrix axis is compromised in HD in relation to the canonical axis. Here we show, using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from male Grade 1 HD patient post-mortem brain samples and male zQ175 and R6/2 mouse models, that the two axes are multiplexed and differentially compromised in HD. In human HD, striosomal indirect-pathway SPNs are the most depleted SPN population. In mouse HD models, the transcriptomic distinctiveness of striosome-matrix SPNs is diminished more than that of direct-indirect pathway SPNs. Furthermore, the loss of striosome-matrix distinction is more prominent within indirect-pathway SPNs. These results open the possibility that the canonical direct-indirect pathway and striosome-matrix compartments are differentially compromised in late and early stages of disease progression, respectively, differentially contributing to the symptoms, thus calling for distinct therapeutic strategies. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as the cause of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic, and its variants, especially those with higher transmissibility and substantial immune evasion, have highlighted the imperative for developing novel therapeutics as sustainable solutions other than vaccination to combat coronaviruses (CoVs). Beside receptor recognition and virus entry, members of the SARS-CoV-2 replication/transcription complex are promising targets for designing antivirals. Here, the interacting residues that mediate protein–protein interactions (PPIs) of nsp10 with nsp16 and nsp14 were comprehensively analyzed, and the key residues’ interaction maps, interaction energies, structural networks, and dynamics were investigated. Nsp10 stimulates both nsp14’s exoribonuclease (ExoN) and nsp16’s 2′O-methyltransferase (2′O-MTase). Nsp14 ExoN is an RNA proofreading enzyme that supports replication fidelity. Nsp16 2′O-MTase is responsible for the completion of RNA capping to ensure efficient replication and translation and escape from the host cell’s innate immune system. The results of the PPIs analysis proposed crucial information with implications for designing SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs. Based on the predicted shared protein–protein interfaces of the nsp16-nsp10 and nsp14-nsp10 interactions, a set of dual-target peptide inhibitors was designed. The designed peptides were evaluated by molecular docking, peptide–protein interaction analysis, and free energy calculations, and then further optimized by in silico saturation mutagenesis. Based on the predicted evolutionary conservation of the interacted target residues among CoVs, the designed peptides have the potential to be developed as dual target pan-coronavirus inhibitors. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a critical target in the prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression. With the goal of developing potential acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, a new series chalcone derivatives of ursolic acid (4–11) were synthesized and characterized by means of their NMR, FTIR and HRMS spectral data. hAChE inhibition abilities of all compounds were tested in vitro. Compounds 10, 8 and 7 showed high hAChE inhibitory potential with the IC50 values of 1.82, 4.65 and 5.36 µM respectively. When compared to the standard inhibitor (Galantamine, IC50= 1.96 µM), compound 10 was the most potent derivative. After performing kinetic studies, KM constant and Vmax value of hAChE were determined as 0.059 mM and 0.052 EU/ml respectively. Inhibition type of compound 10 was found as competitive and Ki constant was calculated as 1.31 ± 0.18 µM. The inhibition mechanism of compounds was predicted by molecular docking, MM/GBSA analysis, molecular dynamics simulation and ADME studies. Molecular docking studies showed that compounds 10, 8, and 7 have highest binding scores (-9.235, -8.827, -8.645 kcal/mol, respectively), while the standard inhibitor galantamine exhibited binding score of -5.106 kcal/mol. According to the MM/GBSA analysis, compounds 10 and 7 displayed binding free energies of -46.19 and -49.19 kcal/mol, respectively, which were higher than the standard's binding free energy of -41.82 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamic simulations were confirmed successful placement of the compounds 10, 8 and 7 in the active site of AChE. The in silico ADME predictions indicated that compound 10 has acceptable potency as a drug in treatment of AD. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Biped robots have attracted increasing attention because of their flexible movement and strong adaptability to the surroundings. However, the small output torque and the weak impact resistance of the motor drive, as well as the large energy consumption of the hydraulic drive limit the performance of the biped robot drive system. Aiming at these shortcomings, an electric-hydraulic hybrid drive system of biped robot was proposed in this paper. The robot platform was designed based on the prototype of the Zhejiang Lab biped robot. The model of the hydraulic drive system and mechanical structure was established to analyze the dynamic characteristic and the load force during walking. The value function reflecting the energy consumption of the hydraulic drive system was proposed. The pressure of the accumulator in the hydraulic power unit was selected as the control parameter. In order to get the minimum value of the value function, so as to reduce the energy consumption of the hydraulic driving system, the control parameters were optimized by using the genetic algorithm. From the simulation results, the proposed optimization algorithm can improve efficiency by 3.49%. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "title": "Predictability of short-term passengers’ origin and destination demands in urban rail transit",
        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of short-term passengers’ origin and destination (OD) demands is key to efficient operation and management of urban rail transit (URT), especially in the case of congestion or an incident. However, short-term OD demand forecasting is more challenging than passenger flow forecasting, due to its uncertainty and high dimensions. So far, most OD prediction models capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of OD flow by means of training models on historical data, but what characteristics and laws influence the performance of OD prediction are still unknown. In this paper, we propose temporal Pearson correlation coefficients and approximate entropy, as well as spatial correlations, as indicators to reflect the inherent time–space correlations and complexity of the OD flow. Then, by analyzing automatic fare collection data of the Beijing and Shanghai URT system, this paper deeply discusses the relationships between the spatio-temporal correlations and complexity of the OD flow and the predictive performances of different models with regard to different intervals. Finally, this paper proposes the predictable problem of travel demands and points out that the spatial correlations of the OD matrix are more important than the temporal correlations and complexity in the short-term prediction of travel demands. In particular, the number of principal components of the OD flow can be a key indicator to measure the forecasting performance of a model. A reasonable interval is very important for short-term OD forecasting, and in the Beijing URT system, 30 min is a preferable choice for workdays and 50 min for weekends. All these findings are beneficial to guide users to build a suitable model or improve the existing model to obtain better prediction performances. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

        "title": "Is low-carbon energy technology a catalyst for driving green total factor productivity development? The case of China",
        "abstract": "Green total factor productivity is a vital measure of sustainable progress, holding immense implications for attaining both economic growth and environmental preservation in a mutually beneficial manner. Focusing on green total factor productivity, this paper examines its nexus with low-carbon energy technology using the Instrumental Variable Generalized Method of Moments (IV-GMM) model, based on a panel dataset in China during 2005–2018. This paper also examines the asymmetric impact of low-carbon energy technology on green total factor productivity. In addition, the moderating and mediating effects are checked. The main findings are that (1) low-carbon energy technology is a promoting factor for green total factor productivity. (2) Low-carbon energy technology exerts a more prominent marginal impact on green total factor productivity when green total factor productivity is at higher quantile levels. (3) Renewable energy generation not only drives green total factor productivity directly, but also further increases the promotion effect of low-carbon energy technology on green total factor productivity, showing a positive moderating role. (4) Energy structure transition and industrial structure transition are two internal impact mechanisms between low-carbon energy technology and green total factor productivity. These findings suggest that the government can promote green total factor productivity development by developing policies related to low-carbon energy technology and fully releasing the effects of technology on sustainable development. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "The discovery of selective agonists of cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is strongly pursued to successfully tuning endocannabinoid signaling for therapeutic purposes. However, the design of selective CB2 agonists is still challenging because of the high homology with the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and for the yet unclear molecular basis of the agonist/antagonist switch. Here, the 1,3-benzoxazine scaffold is presented as a versatile chemotype for the design of CB2 agonists from which 25 derivatives were synthesized. Among these, compound 7b5 (CB2 EC50 = 110 nM, CB1 EC50 > 10 μM) demonstrated to impair proliferation of triple negative breast cancer BT549 cells and to attenuate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a CB2-dependent manner. Furthermore, 7b5 abrogated the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, a key pro-inflammatory and oncogenic enzyme. Finally, molecular dynamics studies suggested a new rationale for the in vitro measured selectivity and for the observed agonist behavior. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS",

        "title": "Modified DNDC model to improve performance of soil temperature simulation under plastic film mulching and snow cover",
        "abstract": "Soil temperature plays a fundamental role in climatological and hydrological modeling as well as in simulating environmental processes and climate change. There are many models to simulate soil temperature, and the denitrification decomposition (DNDC) model is a widely used process-based biogeochemical model among them. However, this model does not simulate soil temperatures well under seasonal snow cover and plastic film mulching in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study, the DNDC model was calibrated and validated using a 9 years (2012–2020) soil temperature dataset from a typical semi-arid region of Gansu province, China (Yuzhong). Then, the model was tested in two other experimental sites in semi-arid regions (Dingxi and Tongwei in Gansu province, China). Model sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the simulated soil temperature was mainly related to air temperature. Model validation results indicated that the measured and simulated soil temperatures were in agreement with each other. Compared with the original model, the average RMSE of the soil temperature in the modified model decreased by 125.3 % and the average R2 increased by 52.1 % in winter under conditions of plastic film mulching and snow cover. For the test dataset, the R, R2, and RMSE of the modified DNDC model were 0.96–0.97, 0.89–0.94, and 2.01–2.76 in the Dingxi experiment site, and 0.94–0.95, 0.88–0.93, and 1.86–3.16, in the Tongwei experiment site, respectively. The performance of the modified model simulation was better than that of the original model. The modified DNDC model can be used as an effective simulation tool to predict soil temperature. The modified model also had good expandability and applicability in different experimental sites in different semi-arid regions. It can be used as an alternative scheme for future soil temperature predictions, and it can provide theoretical input for the formulation of local agricultural strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Affected by periodic reservoir water level fluctuations and seasonal rainfall, most reservoir landslides show a step-like pattern of dynamic switching between accelerated and decelerated deformation states. This paper proposes a novel adaptive interval prediction method for accurate prediction of such step-like landslide displacement. In this method, future deformation state (acceleration or deceleration) of landslide is identified by random forest model. Based on the dual-output least squares support vector machine (DO-LSSVM) model, two independent interval predictors are established to adaptively predict landslide displacement in the accelerated deformation state and the decelerated deformation state, respectively. Landslide triggering factors, including rainfall and reservoir water level fluctuations, are adopted as inputs to train the random forest model and DO-LSSVM predictors. To depict the effectiveness of the proposed method, a typical step-like landslide, the Baishuihe landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir region of China, is taken as a case study. The prediction performance of landslide displacement is evaluated by the prediction interval coverage probability (PICP), the normalized mean prediction interval width (NMPIW), and the modified coverage width-based criterion (CWC). Compared to existing interval prediction methods, the predicted displacement intervals by the proposed method have smaller NMPIW and relatively high PICP. Moreover, the mean and standard deviation values of CWC are much smaller than those obtained from existing methods, showing improved prediction accuracy and reliability. Results of this study confirm good performance of the proposed method in interval predictions of step-like landslide displacement. The prediction results could facilitate early warning of landslide disasters. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

        "title": "Recent advancement in targeted therapy and role of emerging technologies to treat cancer",
        "abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease that causes abnormal cell growth and spread. DNA mutations, chemical or environmental exposure, viral infections, chronic inflammation, hormone abnormalities, etc., are underlying factors that can cause cancer. Drug resistance and toxicity complicate cancer treatment. Additionally, the variability of cancer makes it difficult to establish universal treatment guidelines. Next-generation sequencing has made genetic testing inexpensive. This uncovers genetic mutations that can be treated with specialty drugs. AI (artificial intelligence), machine learning, biopsy, next-generation sequencing, and digital pathology provide personalized cancer treatment. This allows for patient-specific biological targets and cancer treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, CAR-T, and cancer vaccines are promising cancer treatments. Recent trial data incorporating these therapies have shown superiority in clinical outcomes and drug tolerability over conventional chemotherapies. Combinations of these therapies with new technology can change cancer treatment and help many. This review discusses the development and challenges of targeted therapies like monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), dual variable domain (DVD) antibodies, CAR-T therapy, cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA cancer vaccines, and their clinical outcomes in various cancers. We will also study how artificial intelligence and machine learning help find new cancer treatment targets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

        "title": "Energy harvesting in self-sustainable IoT devices and applications based on cross-layer architecture design: A survey",
        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to become a driving force in the evolution of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, autonomous continuous monitoring and control platforms, and low-power consumption devices. Conventionally, these devices are battery-operated. The battery lifespan degrades faster in the case of continuous monitoring devices. Limited battery lifetime motivates us to investigate an eco-friendly solution to solve the issue of limited battery life and frequent replacement. Energy harvesting (EH) is a key-enabling technique that provides a viable solution to the challenge at hand. EH minimizes battery dependence by collecting energy from ambient sources. Although several studies have been conducted on EH-IoT networks, a tutorial on a possible mapping between the use cases/application to the IoT devices and the IoT devices to EH power source still needs to be included. To address this gap, we classify IoT devices based on their applications. Based on the different interfacing sections of layer architecture design of IoT device, this paper tries to fill the gap between IoT applications and the self-sustainable IoT system design. Next, each interfacing section is categorized into layer architecture of IoT device to study layer-specific power requirements (or demand) versus EH sources (or supply). We have considered various applications like agriculture, healthcare, industry, city, security, transportation, and water management. Further, we discuss different energy sources to harness ambient energy and the method to store the harvested energy. Then, the widely used standards and the various steps taken for the interoperability and compatibility of EH-IoT are outlined to understand the elements of the EH interface. Finally, we point out future research issues requiring specific attention for deploying self-sustainable IoT-based delay-limited applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "An accurate and efficient fault detection model based on deep belief network (DBN) in this paper is proposed for rotating machinery. Due to the overlapping problem of different class features extracted by traditional networks, a L2,s -norm and L2,p -norm distance metrics regularized DBN for intelligent fault diagnosis of rotary equipment is proposed in this paper. In the proposed model, we adopt the joint L2,s -norm and L2,p -norm regularized DBN to extract the original data features with an unsupervised manner. Specifically, the L2,p -norm optimizes the spatial distance of features of same-class data, and the L2,p -norm penalizes the spatial distance of features of different-classes data, which can make same-class data more compact and different-classes data more identifiable. Therefore, it can produce more discriminant features and improve the ability of classification. At the same time, two different optimization methods are used to optimize the non-differentiable L2,s -norm and L2,p -norm. Finally, two different kinds of rotating machinery experiments are constructed to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method has more obvious advantages in terms of feature extraction ability and feature clustering. In addition, this method is also superior in the fault diagnosis accuracy of rotating machinery. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

        "title": "The Cost Drivers of Infrastructure Projects: Definition, Classification, and Conceptualization",
        "abstract": "Reducing cost is a critical objective for project teams. However, unlike the research on topics such as cost overruns, cost reduction literature is limited. Previous studies have primarily examined cost estimation and reduction models or high-level cost reduction strategies. Therefore, it is necessary to identify specific actions that project teams can take to reduce cost. By focusing on the \"cost drivers\"of infrastructure projects, researchers have a practically relevant lens through which cost reduction can be promoted and studied. Thus, this integrative literature review establishes a foundation for infrastructure project cost drivers knowledge, addressing three research questions revolving around deriving a definition, classification scheme, and conceptual framework of cost drivers. This paper first produces a definition of cost drivers by critically analyzing cost driver concepts and perspectives and existing definitions. Second, cost drivers were drawn from relevant articles and classified to produce a taxonomy of 14 key cost drivers. Third, a conceptual framework (two-by-two matrix) of cost driver types was developed to acknowledge the influence project teams can have. Finally, a research agenda proposes further investigation in cost drivers and reduction research regarding each cost driver, apt research methods, and necessary project contexts. This paper's theoretical contribution is a deepening of infrastructure project cost drivers knowledge using a definition, taxonomy, and conceptual framework. The practical contribution is a deepened awareness of the key opportunities for - and threats to - cost reduction for project teams, as well as knowledge of those cost drivers that they actually have an influence over, that is, to reduce their project's cost. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

        "title": "Potential of quantum computing to effectively comprehend the complexity of brain",
        "abstract": "Particles that are atomic and subatomic constitute up the entire cosmos. The laws of the quantum world apply to particles as well. It is essential to unravel the still-mysterious enigma of quantum physics in order to comprehend quantum systems. The intricacy of the human brain is almost as complicated as that of the cosmos. All of the aforementioned challenges were addressed in this study from the viewpoint of a quantum system. The comparative study and analysis of the human brain has incorporated use of quantum physics concepts including entanglement, superposition, no-cloning, and uncertainty. Also, this study investigated into how commercial quantum devices may serve hitherto unresolved areas of the brain. Investigations on quantum artificial neural networks that resemble the structure and operation of human neurons have also been undertaken. The effectiveness of the brain with various qubit sizes has then been compared. The authors next examined the efficiency of photon absorption, filtering, and transport as well as the amount of signal lost in the skin, ocular, intracranial, and intercranial spaces. Then, the intra-space and inter-space quantum entanglement error rates were compared using individual qubits, particles, and photons. These research all came to the same conclusion: the quantum mechanical principle may have been directly or indirectly developed from the human brain and other sensory organs. The human body, on the other hand, has a comparatively limited capability for comprehending quantum theory.

        "title": "A 3-dimensional histology computer model of malignant melanoma and its implications for digital pathology",
        "abstract": "Background: Historically, cancer diagnoses have been made by pathologists using two-dimensional histological slides. However, with the advent of digital pathology and artificial intelligence, slides are being digitised, providing new opportunities to integrate their information. Since nature is 3-dimensional (3D), it seems intuitive to digitally reassemble the 3D structure for diagnosis. Objective: To develop the first human-3D-melanoma-histology-model with full data and code availability. Further, to evaluate the 3D-simulation together with experienced pathologists in the field and discuss the implications of digital 3D-models for the future of digital pathology. Methods: A malignant melanoma of the skin was digitised via 3 µm cuts by a slide scanner; an open-source software was then leveraged to construct the 3D model. A total of nine pathologists from four different countries with at least 10 years of experience in the histologic diagnosis of melanoma tested the model and discussed their experiences as well as implications for future pathology. Results: We successfully constructed and tested the first 3D-model of human melanoma. Based on testing, 88.9% of pathologists believe that the technology is likely to enter routine pathology within the next 10 years; advantages include a better reflectance of anatomy, 3D assessment of symmetry and the opportunity to simultaneously evaluate different tissue levels at the same time; limitations include the high consumption of tissue and a yet inferior resolution due to computational limitations. Conclusions: 3D-histology-models are promising for digital pathology of cancer and melanoma specifically, however, there are yet limitations which need to be carefully addressed. © 2023 The Authors",

        "abstract": "A scientometric approach is utilized to investigate the dynamic maps of relationships among researchers, institutes, and countries in the field of Artificial Intelligence for Fluid-flow and Heat-transfer (AIFH). The Web of Science database was searched for related publications during the last 40 years (1982 and 2022). A total of 6151 articles were discovered, which were analyzed in detail. Using a bibliometric analysis, the most relevant and most cited sources of publications were identified. The most active researchers, institutions, and countries leading AIFH were reported. Then, the worldwide dynamic collaboration maps and coupling maps of relationships were reported. The Islamic Azad University (1893 T.C.), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (1374 T.C.), and Beihang University (1266 T.C.) were the most influential institutes in AIFH. The most influential countries were China, the USA, and Iran. The dynamic map of collaborations shows a good worldwide collaboration distribution. The USA and China established the most connection with the rest of the world. ANNs are the most studied topic (19.5% of publications), followed by Machine Learning (17.9%) and Neural Networks (15.4%). Support Vector Machines lag behind at 1.4%. ANNs boast the highest total citations (17,064) and H-index (63). Most ANIF papers were published by Medical Physics (119 T.P.). Half of the articles in AIFH were published by five journals of Medical Physics, Neurocomputing, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, and IEEE Access. The International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer received the most citations in AIFH. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "In the existing work, cost optimization for an R/C structure system was performed by using machine learning. In fetch optimization, the aspects of the shear wall were contemplated as design variables, and the objective was to find the optimal shear wall aspects that keep down the overall cost of the material. The limitations of the structural inflation problem are designed according to the exigencies of the R/C spec stipulation named “IS 456:2000”, IS 13920:1993, and INDIAS Seismic Code, which came into force as IS 1893:1975. Support elements are typically based on the designer's technical knowledge, experience, and intuition. In empirical design implementations, the eventual aspects are usually chosen as one of the bulk appropriate among numerous standard-compliant design choices. Though solely these blueprint alternatives may not be cheap, and the cheapest blueprint could only be apportioned through a more laborious optimization process. An application of the software is also being developed to determine the optimum shear wall dimensions for designing structural systems at a minimal cost. The recommended algorithm trivializes structural costs, including concrete and reinforcement costs, where fetch associated with transport, labor, and shuttering prices are excluded.

        "title": "Monitoring of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of ethanol by multi-source data deep fusion strategy based on near-infrared spectra and electronic nose signals",
        "abstract": "Fuel ethanol represents a future energy trajectory, and the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) technique emerges as the principal approach for ethanol production. This scholarly inquiry offers an innovative means to monitor the SSF process for ethanol meticulously. Employing a profound fusion strategy that effectively amalgamates diverse data sources. The convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures are thoughtfully crafted and designed to enable autonomous feature self-learning from near-infrared spectra and electronic nose data. These intricately devised networks further implement data fusion strategies at the granular level of features. Ultimately, a deep fusion correction model was devised and rigorously validated using two distinct data sources, namely near-infrared spectroscopy and electronic nose data. The obtained results demonstrate a discernible improvement in the overall predictive accuracy of the model when employing the fusion feature strategy, surpassing the model constructed solely on a single technical data source. Regarding the monitoring of ethanol content, the optimal RNN fusion model exhibited remarkable performance metrics, with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) value of 3.2265, a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.9880, and a relative percent deviation (RPD) value of 9.2662. In terms of monitoring glucose content, the optimal RNN fusion model also demonstrated commendable performance, with the following respective parameters: RMSEP was 3.2770, R2 was 0.9840, and RPD was 8.0085. The overall results indicate that the multi-sensor data fusion strategy not only improves the performance of the model but also provides valuable insights into the fermentation process. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "In the era of big data, data presents multi-view, high-dimensional and complex characteristics. For one thing, with multi-view features, the data could be characterized more precisely and comprehensively from different perspectives. For another, high-dimensional multi-view features inevitably generate expensive computation costs and cause massive storage costs. Moreover, since raw data generally contains adverse noise, outlying entries, irrelevant and redundant features, the intrinsic dimension of the data may be much lower than the dimension of the raw data. The low-dimensional and robust data representation can effectively improve model efficiency as well as accuracy and thus is vital for downstream tasks in various fields. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

        "title": "Comparison of one- two- and three-dimensional CNN models for drawing-test-based diagnostics of the Parkinson's disease",
        "abstract": "Subject: In this article, convolutional networks of one, two, and three dimensions are compared with respect to their ability to distinguish between the drawing tests produced by Parkinson's disease patients and healthy control subjects. Motivation: The application of deep learning techniques for the analysis of drawing tests to support the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease has become a growing trend in the area of Artificial Intelligence. Methods: The dynamic features of the handwriting signal are embedded in the static test data to generate one-dimensional time series, two-dimensional RGB images and three-dimensional voxelized point clouds, and then one-, two-, and three-dimensional CNN can be used to automatically extract features for effective diagnosis. Novelty: While there are many results that describe the application of two-dimensional convolutional models to the problem, to the best knowledge of the authors, there are no results based on the application of three-dimensional models and very few using one-dimensional models. Main result: The accuracy of the one-, two- and three-dimensional CNN models was 59.38%, 77.73% and 82.34% in the DraWritePD dataset (acquired by the authors) and 63.33%, 81.33% and 82.22% in the PaHaW dataset (well known from the literature), respectively. For these two data sets, the proposed three-dimensional convolutional classification method exhibits the best diagnostic performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

        "title": "Model aggregation techniques in federated learning: A comprehensive survey",
        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) approach that enables models to be trained on client devices while ensuring the privacy of user data. Model aggregation, also known as model fusion, plays a vital role in FL. It involves combining locally generated models from client devices into a single global model while maintaining user data privacy. However, the accuracy and reliability of the resulting global model depend on the aggregation method chosen, making the selection of an appropriate method crucial. Initially, the simple averaging of model weights was the most commonly used method. However, due to its limitations in handling low-quality or malicious models, alternative techniques have been explored. As FL gains popularity in various domains, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the available model aggregation techniques and their respective strengths and limitations. However, there is currently a significant gap in the literature when it comes to systematic and comprehensive reviews of these techniques. To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review encompassing 201 studies on model aggregation in FL. The focus is on summarizing the proposed techniques and the ones currently applied for model fusion. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers to enhance and develop new aggregation techniques, as well as for practitioners to select the most appropriate method for their FL applications. © 2023 The Author(s)",

        "title": "Spatiotemporal analysis using Riemannian composition of diffusion operators",
        "abstract": "Multivariate time-series have become abundant in recent years, as many data-acquisition systems record information through multiple sensors simultaneously. In this paper, we assume the variables pertain to some geometry and present an operator-based approach for spatiotemporal analysis. Our approach combines three components that are often considered separately: (i) manifold learning for building operators representing the geometry of the variables, (ii) Riemannian geometry of symmetric positive-definite matrices for multiscale composition of operators corresponding to different time samples, and (iii) spectral analysis of the composite operators for extracting different dynamic modes. We propose a method that is analogous to the classical wavelet analysis, which we term Riemannian multi-resolution analysis (RMRA). We provide some theoretical results on the spectral analysis of the composite operators, and we demonstrate the proposed method on simulations and on real data. © 2023 The Author(s)",

        "title": "A hybrid HFACS model using DEMATEL-ORESTE method with linguistic Z-number for risk analysis of human error factors in the healthcare system",
        "abstract": "The human error factor is one of the leading causes of medical errors. Among risk analysis techniques for human error factors, HFACS (Human Factor Analysis and Classification System) method has been regarded as one of the most valuable approaches due to its advantage in potential failure classification. However, the conventional HFACS method is insufficient to handle the risk analysis problem for human error factors considering the interactive relationship among these factors. Moreover, the current fuzzy HFACS frameworks cannot address quantitative risk analysis issues, including imprecision and reliability of information. Thus, this paper constructs an integrated linguistic Z-number-based HFACS framework for analyzing the risk of human error factors. This framework can capture the uncertainty and reliability of the risk evaluation information and the interactive relationships among factors. First, the linguistic Z-number-DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) method is used to generate the comprehensive risk matrix of human error factors identified by the HFACS method. Then, an extended linguistic Z-number-ORESTE method based on the score function is presented to prioritize the risk of human error factors, which can show the preference, indifference, and incomparability relationship among human error factors. Finally, a case study of a healthcare system is conducted to illustrate the reliability of the proposed method. The result of this case indicates that inadequate resources are the most severe risk. Sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis indicate the necessity of considering the effect of the semantics of language terms and the interrelationships between human error factors on risk analysis results. These results show that the proposed hybrid framework is a reliable means to analyze the risk of human error factors within the HFACS method. © 2023",

        "abstract": "Industry 5.0 is an emerging phase in the industrial field where humans and the latest technologies work together to bring revolutionary changes to work processes. It is the future of the upcoming generation for smart city development. Operations and designing of smart systems for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices include various types of decision-making at different levels of domains. Highly complex systems have a huge number of variables and decision-making requirements which also needs real-time data gathering from IIoT devices. Fog computing performs a key role by locating IIoT devices close to its proximity and reducing the processing time in comparison to cloud computing for smart systems. It makes smart systems work in a secure, flexible and time-sensitive manner. The presence of sensors makes data-intensive analysis challenging in these systems but fog computing handles it all. Along with other challenges, security is also one of the concerns that can affect the overall system if compromised. The main objective of this article is to introduce hierarchical fog computing-based architecture for smart energy-supplying systems as a part of Industry 5.0. This architecture will be able to support a large number of infrastructural components and provide services efficiently. In this article, validation of the amount of data transmitted by IIoT devices to the cloud per second is done for three different cases: 1. The proposed four-layer fog computing architecture, 2. Fog architecture with only layer three layers with the rest of the computing on the cloud, 3. A traditional system with cloud computing. The proposed approach is validated over state of art approaches in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the security of the architecture is provided using the Attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, which ensures data confidentiality with minimum overhead. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

At the same time, the advent of the quantum computing era has brought unprecedented challenges to traditional cryptography. Fortunately, a lattice-based PKEET scheme can solve the above problems. In this paper, we design a lattice-based PKE-DET scheme that can support the delegated tester function with satisfying anti-quantum computing security and resisting OMRA attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first PKE-DET scheme that has both kinds of security at the same time. Under the standard model, we prove the security of the scheme based on the LWE hardness assumption. Compared with existing schemes, our scheme has many advantages, such as high security, delegated tester authorization, and small storage space. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Traditional earthquake-resistant structural design considers only a limited number of factors, mainly elastic structural properties, to determine key design parameters. However, these parameters are often not optimal because they do not take into account the extensive plasticity expected in building structures during earthquakes. To address this issue, an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted simulation-driven framework has been developed in this study. This framework can automatically output optimal design parameters while considering nonlinear structural response under strong earthquakes and a large number of input factors. The primary innovation of the proposed framework lies in the fusion and integration of nonlinear numerical simulation and AI tools for earthquake-resistant design of building structures, marking a promising trend in this field. The framework consists of two steps. In the first step, a database that consists of optimal design parameters and covers a wide range of design inputs will be created through numerical nonlinear response history analyses (NRHAs). In the second step, AI models will be created and trained based on the database to automatically output the optimal design parameters. To illustrate the basic components underlying the proposed framework, the determination of the height-wise distribution (denoted by Ψ) of the total design lateral force for a strong back system is taken as an example. A database of 1200 samples was created through NRHAs, and an artificial neural network (ANN) model was created, optimised, and trained. The developed ANN model yielded optimal Ψ with the majority of absolute errors within 1%, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed AI-assisted simulation-driven earthquake-resistant design framework. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "With substantial data storage requirements, enhancing the storage density of emerging non-volatile memories is a common challenge for achieving commercial applications. Phase change memory is capable of multi-level data storage in a storage cell, which can be applied in neural-inspired and all-photonic memory computing. In this study, we propose a MnTe/GeTe stacked thin film structure suitable for multi-level phase change memories and systematically study on the correlation between structure and performance. As the temperature rises, the stacked thin film sequentially crystallizes into form MnTe2, GeTe and Te phases, resulting in three changes in resistance. By utilizing different resistance states, the phase change memory cell based on the MnTe (15 nm)/GeTe (35 nm) stacked thin film can achieve multi-level storage with a 50 ns electrical pulse. The results show that the amorphous thermal stability of the stacked thin films is improved and that the minimal thickness variation before and after crystallization enhances its reliability. Therefore, the MnTe/GeTe stacked thin film is a phase change memory material with favorable structural properties and potential for multi-level storage applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic illness wherein relapses contribute to significant patient morbidity and mortality. Near-term prediction of relapses in MDD patients has the potential to improve outcomes by helping implement a ‘predict and preempt’ paradigm in clinical care. In this study, we developed a novel personalized (N-of-1) encoder-decoder anomaly detection-based framework of combining anomalies in multivariate actigraphy features (passive) as triggers to utilize an active concurrent self-reported symptomatology questionnaire (core symptoms of depression and anxiety) to predict near-term relapse in MDD. The framework was evaluated on two independent longitudinal observational trials, characterized by regular bimonthly (every other month) in-person clinical assessments, weekly self-reported symptom assessments, and continuous activity monitoring data with two different wearable sensors for ≥ 1 year or until the first relapse episode. This combined passive-active relapse prediction framework achieved a balanced accuracy of ≥ 71%, false alarm rate of ≤ 2.3 alarm/patient/year with a median relapse detection time of 2–3 weeks in advance of clinical onset in both studies. The study results suggest that the proposed personalized N-of-1 prediction framework is generalizable and can help predict a majority of MDD relapses in an actionable time frame with relatively low patient and provider burden. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "Interest in the Wireless Medical Sensor Network (WMSN) is rapidly gaining attention thanks to recent advances in semiconductors and wireless communication. However, by virtue of the sensitive medical applications and the stringent resource constraints, there is a need to develop a routing protocol to fulfill WMSN requirements in terms of delivery reliability, attack resiliency, computational overhead, and energy efficiency. This paper proposes 3R, a reliable multi agent reinforcement learning routing protocol for WMSN. 3R uses a novel resource-conservative Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to reduce the computational overhead, along with two updating methods to speed up the algorithm convergence. The reward function is re-defined as a punishment, combining the proposed trust management system to defend against well-known dropping attacks. Furthermore, an energy model is integrated with the reward function to enhance the network lifetime and balance energy consumption across the network. The proposed energy model only uses local information to avoid the resource burdens and the security concerns of exchanging energy information. Experimental results prove the lightweightness, attacks resiliency and energy efficiency of 3R, making it a potential routing candidate for WMSN. © 2023 The Author(s)",

        "title": "The preliminary in vitro study and application of deep learning algorithm in cone beam computed tomography image implant recognition",
        "abstract": "To properly repair and maintain implants, which are bone tissue implants that replace natural tooth roots, it is crucial to accurately identify their brand and specification. Deep learning has demonstrated outstanding capabilities in analysis, such as image identification and classification, by learning the inherent rules and degrees of representation of data models. The purpose of this study is to evaluate deep learning algorithms and their supporting application software for their ability to recognize and categorize three dimensional (3D) Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images of dental implants. By using CBCT technology, the 3D imaging data of 27 implants of various sizes and brands were obtained. Following manual processing, the data were transformed into a data set that had 13,500 two-dimensional data. Nine deep learning algorithms including GoogleNet, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, ResNet101, ResNet101V2, ResNet152 and ResNet152V2 were used to perform the data. Accuracy rates, confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC, number of model parameters and training times were used to assess the efficacy of these algorithms. These 9 deep learning algorithms achieved training accuracy rates of 100%, 99.3%, 89.3%, 99.2%, 99.1%, 99.5%, 99.4%, 99.5%, 98.9%, test accuracy rates of 98.3%, 97.5%, 94.8%, 85.4%, 92.5%, 80.7%, 93.6%, 93.2%, 99.3%, area under the curve (AUC) values of 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00. When used to identify implants, all nine algorithms perform satisfactorily, with ResNet152V2 achieving the highest test accuracy, classification accuracy, confusion matrix area under the curve, and receiver operating characteristic curve area under the curve area. The results showed that the ResNet152V2 has the best classification effect on identifying implants. The artificial intelligence identification system and application software based on this algorithm can efficiently and accurately identify the brands and specifications of 27 classified implants through processed 3D CBCT images in vitro, with high stability and low recognition cost. © 2023, The Author(s).",

        "abstract": "There is ongoing scientific discussion on the role of innovative technologies in enhancing teaching and learning. Technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, artificial intelligence, and generative artificial intelligence have sparked debates in the broader literature. To contribute to ongoing discussions on these topics and to bridge gaps existing in works of literature on the potentials and challenges of innovative technologies like virtual reality, this paper provides insights from students and teachers on the use of virtual reality for teaching speaking skills so far lacking in academic prose in this domain. Given that this study only focused on obtaining student and teacher insights, a mixed-method research design that used questionnaires and interviews was implemented to investigate this study. After obtaining and analyzing data from 85 participants, the study found that although virtual reality could have improved students' speaking skills more efficiently, it was a fun and exciting learning experience for the students and teachers. Other novel findings of the study were instrumental in making pedagogic conclusions on the study's objective. © 2023, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",

        "abstract": "With the continuously increasing number of security incidents targeting sensors, embedded devices, and other electronics appliances and systems that comprise the so-called Internet of things (IoT), the field of IoT forensics emerged as a branch of digital forensics focusing on the investigation of attacks in the IoT ecosystem. Digital evidence authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, and privacy are among the factors affecting the investigation process in IoT forensics, which can be addressed by employing the blockchain as the means not only for the preservation of digital evidence, but also for other steps of a digital forensics investigation process. The high-level goal of the paper is three-fold: to establish a holistic IoT forensics process as a reference point against which blockchain integration patterns and best practices will be identified in order to yield a robust, widely accepted and scalable architecture of the blockchain-enabled solution; to integrate the blockchain with the proposed IoT forensics process for addressing the above challenges; and to evaluate the overall solution highlighting improvements and potential performance bottlenecks. The proposed blockchain-enabled platform leverages multi-access edge computing and has been implemented with Hyperledger Fabric on an extensive virtualized testbed providing a realistic smart home environment. A thorough evaluation was conducted with real cyber-attacks generating digital evidence at high rates for testing the platform's behavior at high load. The experimental results showed that the proposed platform achieved high throughput, excessively low latency, and zero error rate in the operation of the blockchain network. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

        "title": "Systematic review: fluid biomarkers and machine learning methods to improve the diagnosis from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease",
        "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered an early stage of dementia, with estimated rates of progression to dementia up to 80–90% after approximately 6 years from the initial diagnosis. Diagnosis of cognitive impairment in dementia is typically based on clinical evaluation, neuropsychological assessments, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and neuroimaging. The main goal of diagnosing MCI is to determine its cause, particularly whether it is due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, only a limited percentage of the population has access to etiological confirmation, which has led to the emergence of peripheral fluid biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for dementias, including MCI due to AD. Recent advances in biofluid assays have enabled the use of sophisticated statistical models and multimodal machine learning (ML) algorithms for the diagnosis of MCI based on fluid biomarkers from CSF, peripheral blood, and saliva, among others. This approach has shown promise for identifying specific causes of MCI, including AD. After a PRISMA analysis, 29 articles revealed a trend towards using multimodal algorithms that incorporate additional biomarkers such as neuroimaging, neuropsychological tests, and genetic information. Particularly, neuroimaging is commonly used in conjunction with fluid biomarkers for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our systematic review suggests that cost-effective longitudinal multimodal monitoring data, representative of diverse cultural populations and utilizing white-box ML algorithms, could be a valuable contribution to the development of diagnostic models for AD due to MCI. Clinical assessment and biomarkers, together with ML techniques, could prove pivotal in improving diagnostic tools for MCI due to AD. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",

        "abstract": "The Transition towards sustainable energy systems requires phasing out fossil fuels. Hydropower is a key source of renewable energy and can contribute to reaching a 100 % low carbon-based energy system. Uncertainty remains about land cover changes due to hydropower deployment with a widespread perception of major losses in the land from inundation and associated habitat loss in the surrounding areas due to improved access and recreational use. Norway has a dominant share of hydropower generation in Europe with knowledge gaps in the associated land cover changes. We conducted one of the first retrospective analyses of land use change associated with hydropower development in Norway during the last 80 years. Using remote sensing data, we performed object-based analysis on sets of aerial images representing land systems before and after hydropower construction. We quantified the change in the land due to development of 40 hydropower schemes representing 24 % of the total Norwegian installed capacity. Our analysis revealed that 88 % of analyzed reservoirs were developed by regulating or expanding natural lakes. Vegetation growth was observed in the surrounding regions of 22 of 40 schemes, while urbanization was limited to only 0.9 % of the total surrounding area, primarily located within 400 m from reservoir's borders. Our findings provide insights into interaction between land use change and hydropower development in Norway. Our work provides a basis for further assessment of relevant environmental impacts and can be used to quantify expected land changes due to an increase in Norway's hydropower with integration into the European energy market. © 2023 The Author(s)",

        "abstract": "This article provides a combined geospatial artificial intelligence-machine learning, geoAI-ML, agent-based, data-driven, technology-rich, bottom-up approach and datasets for capturing the human dimension in climate-energy-economy models. Seven stages were required to conduct this study and build thirteen datasets to characterise and parametrise geospatial agents in 28 regions, globally. Fundamentally, the methodology starts collecting and handling data, ending with the application of the ModUlar energy system Simulation Environment (MUSE), ResidentiAl Spatially-resolved and temporal-explicit Agents (RASA) model. MUSE-RASA uses AI-ML-based geospatial big data analytics to define eight scenarios to explore long-term transition pathways towards net-zero emission targets by mid-century. The framework and datasets are key for climate-energy-economy models considering consumer behaviour and bounded rationality in more realistic decision-making processes beyond traditional approaches. This approach defines energy economic agents as heterogeneous and diverse entities that evolve in space and time, making decisions under exogenous constraints. This framework is based on the Theory of Bounded Rationality, the Theory of Real Competition, the theoretical foundations of agent-based modelling and the progress on the combination of GIS-ABM. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",

        "title": "Coordination of drones at scale: Decentralized energy-aware swarm intelligence for spatio-temporal sensing",
        "abstract": "Smart City applications, such as traffic monitoring and disaster response, often use swarms of intelligent and cooperative drones to efficiently collect sensor data over different areas of interest and time spans. However, when the required sensing becomes spatio-temporally large and varying, a collective arrangement of sensing tasks to a large number of battery-restricted and distributed drones is challenging. To address this problem, this paper introduces a scalable and energy-aware model for planning and coordination of spatio-temporal sensing. The coordination model is built upon a decentralized multi-agent collective learning algorithm (EPOS) to ensure scalability, resilience, and flexibility that existing approaches lack of. Experimental results illustrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. Analytical results contribute a deeper understanding of how coordinated mobility of drones influences sensing performance. This novel coordination solution is applied to traffic monitoring using real-world data to demonstrate a 46.45% more accurate and 2.88% more efficient detection of vehicles as the number of drones become a scarce resource. © 2023 The Author(s)",

        "title": "Scene clusters, causes, spatial patterns and strategies in the cultural landscape heritage of Tang Poetry Road in Eastern Zhejiang based on text mining",
        "abstract": "The burgeoning field of digital humanities has provided important modern technological means for text mining in literary works. Chinese classical poetry, as a treasure in the world’s artistic treasury, holds significant value in recognizing the heritage of world culture. In this study, taking the 1589 Tang poems from the Tang Poetry Road in Eastern Zhejiang as an example, we constructed a research framework that explores the aesthetics of classical Chinese poetry landscapes and spatial imagery at the urban agglomeration scale by utilizing geographic and analytical tools such as Python programming, Gephi co-occurrence semantic networks, and GIS kernel density analysis. The framework exhibits three key innovations: (1) a text processing approach that treats individual characters as semantic units in ancient poetry texts, (2) a combined approach of Python programming techniques and Gephi visualization tool for social network analysis, and (3) a study focusing on the integration of textual and spatial aspects of literary landscape heritage corridors at the urban cluster scale. The constructed framework greatly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of Tang poetry text mining, it enables the extraction of natural and cultural landscape spatial imagery along the Tang Poetry Road, the construction of scene depictions, the identification of key regions within the scenes, and the derivation of location-specific strategies. This study broadens the scope of exploring the cultural heritage value of Tang poetry literature and provides practical guidance for the development of cross-regional heritage corridors. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

        "abstract": "Climate-sensitive diseases developing from heat or cold stress threaten human health. Therefore, the future health risk induced by climate change and the aging of society need to be assessed. We developed a prediction model for mortality due to cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction, which are weather or climate sensitive, using machine learning (ML) techniques. We evaluated the daily mortality of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and cerebrovascular disease (CEV) in Tokyo and Osaka City, Japan, during summer. The significance of delayed effects of daily maximum temperature and other weather elements on mortality was previously demonstrated using a distributed lag nonlinear model. We conducted ML by a LightGBM algorithm that included specified lag days, with several temperature- and air pressure-related elements, to assess the respective mortality risks for IHD and CEV, based on training and test data for summer 2010–2019. These models were used to evaluate the effect of climate change on the risk for IHD mortality in Tokyo by applying transfer learning (TL). ML with TL predicted that the daily IHD mortality risk in Tokyo would averagely increase by 29% and 35% at the 95th and 99th percentiles, respectively, using a high-level warming-climate scenario in 2045–2055, compared to the risk simulated using ML in 2009–2019. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",

        "title": "Effects of internet addiction scores on informational search by undergraduate students",
        "abstract": "The study examined the relationship between internet addiction and university students’ use of a network to gain information. Two hundred undergraduate students (aged 18–21 years) were recruited from Science, Social Science, and Arts faculties. They each had 30 min to browse one of two network architectures: a simple hierarchal structure, or a complex relational structure. After the session, they took a test on the content of the network, completed the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and were asked about their time spent on the internet. There was no effect of university faculty (subject) on any of the results. More pages were revisited using the hierarchical than the relational network structure. However, there were interactions between levels of internet addiction (IAT score) and the type of network. Participants who had lower IAT scores, exposed to hierarchical network, visited a greater proportion of pages, revisited fewer pages, and achieved higher test scores, than lower IAT scorers exposed to the relational network. However, participants with higher IAT scores showed little difference in performance between the networks. There was little impact of IAT score on performance on hierarchical networks, but performance on relational networks improved as IAT scores increased. These data suggest that simple hierarchical networks are better for those with lower internet addiction (as measured by low IAT scores), but there is little difference in network for those with higher internet addiction (higher IAT scores). © 2023 The Author(s)",

        "abstract": "Digital Twins (DTs) provide a promising solution for the maintenance and operation of bridges, thanks to their ability to mirror physical/structural conditions. A bridge DT generally consists of a geometric-semantic model whose creation, however, requires extensive manual effort. This paper presents an automated framework to generate the parametric model of bridges from their segmented point clouds. Following the concept of reverse engineering with parametric modeling, Parametric Prototype Models (PPMs) are proposed as tools to extract parameter values from point clouds. A local and global optimization problem is defined to adjust and assemble PPMs into an integrated model. The proposed approach has been validated by applying it to the point cloud of bridge components as well as point clouds captured from six concrete bridges in Bavaria, Germany. The results show that the proposed approach can generate the parametric model of bridges with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.71 cm. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Pavement surface texture is an essential factor in influencing the sound emission of vehicles, and reducing noise pollution would be a big issue for all humans. According to the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) R-117 requirement, all the vehicle tires vending in Europe should pass noise accreditation after September 2009, and the pavement surface of the test track should follow ISO 10844. The Mean Profile Depth (MPD) is adopted to be the texture parameter of the test track surface in ISO 10844. the MPD of the Test track should be controlled at specific intervals, and the material design should be a big challenge of pavement Engineering. This study aims to establish an MPD prediction function with material properties for pavement Engineers. In material, there were two fine aggregates, three gradation curves, three air voids of the specimen, and 18 mixture designs adopted in this study. There were three specimens in each mixture design; the total specimen number was 54 for MPD measurement. Fifty-four laboratory test specimens were compacted using a Superpave gyratory compactor (SGC). A High-Definition Pavement Texture Machine (HDPTM) measured the specimen surface MPD. The parameters in this study included fineness module (FM), fine aggregate angularity (FAA), air void (AV) of the specimen, and Gyration number (G) of SGC. Gene Expression Programming (GEP) was adopted to build a prediction model between MPD and various parameters. Based on the results of this study, the best MPD forecasting model using FAA, FM, and AV, the R2 of is 0.74, meaning the best MPD forecasting model could be a very nice tool to help pavement engineers to do MPD quality control on the test track for ISO 10844. In addition, GEP was an excellent method to discover the nonlinear relationship between MPD and various parameters of asphalt concrete, and it was worthy of further study. © 2023 The Authors",

        "title": "Neurophysiological signatures of cortical micro-architecture",
        "abstract": "Systematic spatial variation in micro-architecture is observed across the cortex. These micro-architectural gradients are reflected in neural activity, which can be captured by neurophysiological time-series. How spontaneous neurophysiological dynamics are organized across the cortex and how they arise from heterogeneous cortical micro-architecture remains unknown. Here we extensively profile regional neurophysiological dynamics across the human brain by estimating over 6800 time-series features from the resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) signal. We then map regional time-series profiles to a comprehensive multi-modal, multi-scale atlas of cortical micro-architecture, including microstructure, metabolism, neurotransmitter receptors, cell types and laminar differentiation. We find that the dominant axis of neurophysiological dynamics reflects characteristics of power spectrum density and linear correlation structure of the signal, emphasizing the importance of conventional features of electromagnetic dynamics while identifying additional informative features that have traditionally received less attention. Moreover, spatial variation in neurophysiological dynamics is co-localized with multiple micro-architectural features, including gene expression gradients, intracortical myelin, neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, and oxygen and glucose metabolism. Collectively, this work opens new avenues for studying the anatomical basis of neural activity. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",

        "abstract": "Background: We aimed to develop machine learning models for prediction of molecular subgroups (low-risk group and intermediate/high-risk group) and molecular marker (KIAA1549-BRAF fusion) of pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) based on radiomic features extracted from multiparametric MRI. Methods: 61 patients with PLGGs were included in this retrospective study, which were divided into a training set and an internal validation set at a ratio of 2:1 based on the molecular subgroups or the molecular marker. The patients were classified into low-risk and intermediate/high-risk groups, BRAF fusion positive and negative groups, respectively. We extracted 5929 radiomic features from multiparametric MRI. Thereafter, we removed redundant features, trained random forest models on the training set for predicting the molecular subgroups or the molecular marker, and validated their performance on the internal validation set. The performance of the prediction model was verified by 3-fold cross-validation. Results: We constructed the classification model differentiating low-risk PLGGs from intermediate/high-risk PLGGs using 4 relevant features, with an AUC of 0.833 and an accuracy of 76.2% in the internal validation set. In the prediction model for predicting KIAA1549-BRAF fusion using 4 relevant features, an AUC of 0.818 and an accuracy of 81.0% were achieved in the internal validation set. Conclusions: The current study demonstrates that MRI radiomics is able to predict molecular subgroups of PLGGs and KIAA1549-BRAF fusion with satisfying sensitivity.

        "abstract": "Mental stress is found to be strongly connected with human cognition and wellbeing. As the complexities of human life increase, the effects of mental stress have impacted human health and cognitive performance across the globe. This highlights the need for effective non-invasive stress detection methods. In this work, we introduce a novel, artificial spiking neural network model called Online Neuroplasticity Spiking Neural Network (O-NSNN) that utilizes a repertoire of learning concepts inspired by the brain to classify mental stress using Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. These models are personalized and tested on EEG data recorded during sessions in which participants listen to different types of audio comments designed to induce acute stress. Our O-NSNN models learn on the fly producing an average accuracy of 90.76% (σ = 2.09) when classifying EEG signals of brain states associated with these audio comments. The brain-inspired nature of the individual models makes them robust and efficient and has the potential to be integrated into wearable technology. Furthermore, this article presents an exploratory analysis of trained O-NSNNs to discover links between perceived and acute mental stress. The O-NSNN algorithm proved to be better for personalized stress recognition in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and model interpretability. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",

        "title": "Semi-supervised attribute reduction based on label distribution and label irrelevance",
        "abstract": "Attribute reduction in partially labeled data, also called semi-supervised attribute reduction, is an important issue. In recent years, the research on semi-supervised attribute reduction has attracted the attention of many scholars. Unfortunately, most existing semi-supervised attribute reduction methods do not handle the information loss caused by missing labels well. Meanwhile, these methods in general only consider the relevance between attributes and labels to measure attribute correlations, which ignores the irrelevant information contained in the attributes with respect to the labels. In view of this, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised attribute reduction algorithm considering attribute relevance, redundancy and label irrelevance from the perspective of label distribution. Firstly, the membership degree of unlabeled objects relative to labels is defined by fuzzy similarity relation, which implements information restoration and converts partially labeled data into label distribution data. Secondly, some fuzzy uncertainty measures for label distribution are defined and related properties are investigated accordingly. Additionally, considering that irrelevant information brought by attributes may lead to over-fitting, label irrelevance criterion based on fuzzy uncertainty measures is constructed. Thirdly, a novel semi-supervised attribute reduction algorithm via the maximum relevance, minimum redundancy, and minimum irrelevance is proposed. Finally, compared with the representative semi-supervised attribute reduction algorithms and supervised attribute reduction algorithm, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by various experiments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

        "title": "Pragmatic evidence of cross-language link detection: A systematic literature review",
        "abstract": "There is a rising trend for heterogeneous software applications involving multilingual source code. The key focus of reverse engineers is to unravel the cross-language links (XLLs) and their dependencies. This study aims to perform a systematic literature review (SLR) to compile different approaches, tools, techniques, and shortcomings of such techniques and understand the XLLs and their dependencies while performing reverse engineering on state-of-the-art software applications. This SLR selects 76 primary studies and uses them to create a ’go-to’ literature database, where professionals from software engineering could find all the content pertinent to the analysis and XLL detection for major multilingual applications like Java enterprise applications, Android applications, etc. It has been observed that traditional source code analysis mechanisms to reverse engineer contemporary software applications face scores of problems and limitations that need to be addressed. To assist the community in the above-mentioned goal, a general schema with definitions of XLLs and associated concepts is furnished. This study provides an SLR on XLLs, comprehensive taxonomy called cross-language analysis, which incorporates all the methods for XLL detection in multilingual source code. By pursuing future directions suggested in the end, researchers and practitioners can advance the field of multilingual applications; such as Enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions, and cross-language software corpora, leading to improved software development practices and better understanding of language interactions in multilingual environments. The research data provided in the survey presents a comprehensive analysis of the complexities involved in working with diverse programming languages and frameworks, offering valuable insights for language technology researchers, software developers, academics, and decision-makers. This integration will enable them to identify and manage dependencies across diverse languages, leading to more efficient and reliable multilingual software systems. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

        "title": "Deploying efficient net batch normalizations (BNs) for grading diabetic retinopathy severity levels from fundus images",
        "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the main causes of blindness in people around the world. Early diagnosis and treatment of DR can be accomplished by organizing large regular screening programs. Still, it is difficult to spot diabetic retinopathy timely because the situation might not indicate signs in the primary stages of the disease. Due to a drastic increase in diabetic patients, there is an urgent need for efficient diabetic retinopathy detecting systems. Auto-encoders, sparse coding, and limited Boltzmann machines were used as a few past deep learning (DL) techniques and features for the classification of DR. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been identified as a promising solution for detecting and classifying DR. We employ the deep learning capabilities of efficient net batch normalization (BNs) pre-trained models to automatically acquire discriminative features from fundus images. However, we successfully achieved F1 scores above 80% on all efficient net BNs in the EYE-PACS dataset (calculated F1 score for DeepDRiD another dataset) and the results are better than previous studies. In this paper, we improved the accuracy and F1 score of the efficient net BNs pre-trained models on the EYE-PACS dataset by applying a Gaussian Smooth filter and data augmentation transforms. Using our proposed technique, we have achieved F1 scores of 84% and 87% for EYE-PACS and DeepDRiD. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",

        "abstract": "Background: The covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of living systematic reviews. The speed of evidence generated during the covid-19 pandemic accentuated the challenges of managing high volumes of research literature. Methods: In this article, we summarise the characteristics of ongoing living systematic reviews on covid-19, and we follow a life cycle approach to describe key steps in a living systematic review. Results: We identified 97 living systematic reviews on covid-19, published up to 7th November 2022, which focused mostly on the effects of pharmacological interventions (n = 46, 47%) or the prevalence of associated conditions or risk factors (n = 30, 31%). The scopes of several reviews overlapped considerably. Most living systematic reviews included both observational and randomised study designs (n = 45, 46%). Only one-third of the reviews has been updated at least once (n = 34, 35%). We address practical aspects of living systematic reviews including how to judge whether to start a living systematic review, methods for study identification and selection, data extraction and evaluation, and give recommendations at each step, drawing from our own experience. We also discuss when it is time to stop and how to publish updates. Conclusions: Methods to improve the efficiency of searching, study selection, and data extraction using machine learning technologies are being developed, their performance and applicability, particularly for reviews based on observational study designs should improve, and ways of publishing living systematic reviews and their updates will continue to evolve. Finally, knowing when to end a living systematic review is as important as knowing when to start. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",

        "abstract": "Rational design of self-assembled DNA nanostructures has become one of the fastest-growing research areas in molecular science. Particular attention is focused on the development of dynamic DNA nanodevices whose configuration and function are regulated by specific chemical inputs. Herein, we demonstrate the concept of metal-mediated base-pair switching to induce inter- and intramolecular DNA strand displacement in a metal-responsive manner. The 5-hydroxyuracil (U  OH) nucleobase is employed as a metal-responsive unit, forming both a hydrogen-bonded U  OH–A base pair and a metal-mediated U  OH–GdIII–U  OH base pair. Metal-mediated strand displacement reactions are demonstrated under isothermal conditions based on the base-pair switching between U  OH–A and U  OH–GdIII–U  OH. Furthermore, metal-responsive DNA tweezers and allosteric DNAzymes are developed as typical models for DNA nanodevices simply by incorporating U  OH bases into the sequence. The metal-mediated base-pair switching will become a versatile strategy for constructing stimuli-responsive DNA nanostructures, expanding the scope of dynamic DNA nanotechnology. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",

        "title": "Human Activity Recognition Using Hybrid Coronavirus Disease Optimization Algorithm for Internet of Medical Things",
        "abstract": "Background: In our current digital world, smartphones are no longer limited to communication but are used in various real-world applications. In the healthcare industry, smartphones have sensors that can record data about our daily activities. Such data can be used for many healthcare purposes, such as elderly healthcare services, early disease diagnoses, and archiving patient data for further use. However, the data collected from the various sensors involve high dimensional features, which are not equally helpful in human activity recognition (HAR). Methods: This paper proposes an algorithm for selecting the most relevant subset of features that will contribute efficiently to the HAR process. The proposed method is based on a hybrid version of the recent Coronavirus Disease Optimization Algorithm (COVIDOA) with Simulated Annealing (SA). SA algorithm is merged with COVIDOA to improve its performance and help escape the local optima problem. Results: The UCI-HAR dataset from the UCI machine learning repository assesses the proposed algorithm’s performance. A comparison is conducted with seven well-known feature selection algorithms, including the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA), Zebra Optimization Algorithm (ZOA), Gradient-Based Optimizer (GBO), Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), and Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA) regarding fitness, STD, accuracy, size of selected subset, and processing time. Conclusions: The results proved that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art HAR techniques, achieving an average performance of 97.82% in accuracy and a reduction ratio in feature selection of 52.7%. © 2023 by the authors.",

        "abstract": "Student engagement is a flexible, complicated concept that includes behavioural, emotional, and cognitive involvement. In order for the instructor to understand how the student interacts with the various activities in the classroom, it is essential to predict their participation. The current work aims to identify the best algorithm for predicting student engagement in the classroom. In this paper, we gathered data from VLE and prepared them using a variety of data preprocessing techniques, including the elimination of missing values, normalization, encoding, and identification of outliers. On our data, we ran a number of machine learning (ML) classification algorithms, and we assessed each one using cross-validation methods and many helpful indicators. The performance of the model is evaluated with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores. The results show that the CATBoost model is having higher accuracy than the rest. This proposed model outperformed in all the aspects compared to previous research. The results part of this paper indicates that the CATBoost model had an accuracy of approximately 92.23%, a precision of 94.40%, a recall of 100%, and an AUC score of 0.9624. The XGBoost predictive model, the random forest model, and the multilayer perceptron model all demonstrated approximately the same performance overall. We compared the AISAR model with Our model achieved an accuracy of 94.64% compared with AISAR 91% model and it concludes that our results are better. The AISAR model had only around 50% recall compared to our models, which had around 92%. This shows that our models return more relevant results, i.e., if our models predict that a student has high engagement, they are correct 94.64% of the time. © 2023 by the authors.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, novel in-situ oxidation precipitation of ferrous hydroxide method is used to synthesized Fe3O4 nanoparticles and Polyethylene glycol 200 is used for covalent functionalization. Various characterizations tests (FESEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR, HRTEM) were performed, and the Polyethylene glycol treated Iron oxides functionalization was confirmed. Thermal conductivity, density, specific heat, and viscosity were experimentally assessed and validated using the correlations that were available. The corresponding improvements in thermophysical characteristics were 13.35%, 0.06%, 0.37%, and 20.9% at 0.1 wt% and 35°C. UV–vis spectroscopy and Zeta protentional was used to check the stability of nanofluids and found that nanofluid was stable for 30 days. A flat plate solar collector was experimentally installed, and the thermal performance of collector was calculated using ferrofluid under ASHRAE standard 93–2003 at different heat flux intensities (597,775,988 W/m2), mass flow rates ((0.0133, 0.0200, 0.0266 kg/s), inlet fluid temperature (30–50°C) and weight concentrations (0.025,0.05,0.075,0.1%). The highest thermal efficiency enhancement of 13.83% was noticed. Moreover, the ANSYS-CFD model was used for the numerical analysis of the thermal performance of flat plate collector at the same environmental conditions, and a maximum difference of 8.33% at 0.1 wt% was noticed in comparison with experimental data. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Design Science Research in Information Systems (IS) is a research paradigm that aids in the understanding of a problem and subsequent solution development through a process of artefact development. This approach therefore seems applicable to the field of educational technology, where the main objective is the optimal delivery and improvement of learning and ultimately the ability to practically apply what has been learnt, including the use of technology. Furthermore, the continuous need to prepare learners for the future and subsequent Society 5.0 environment - which requires active participation and knowledge of innovative technologies post-graduation - requires educational institutions to take cognizance of teaching approaches which can aid in the optimization of the learning process, for example the utilization of artefacts in the transfer of knowledge to learners. The objective of this research is to perform a high-level scan of relevant published articles in support of our quest to investigate how Design Science Research in IS as an educational technology is currently used in teaching and learning environments. This is important to academics as it highlights the possibility of new teaching approaches and identifies possible gaps in current literature. From a practical perspective the literature pool provides information on how, by providing evidence, Design Science Research in IS can be used as educational technology. After conducting a systematic literature review, a final literature pool of 58 articles were considered. From the abstracts in literature, three main themes emerged – Design Science Research in IS focus on improving administrative processes often handled by learning management systems (LMS) used by educators and learners; improve the learning environment itself through technology enablement; and produce artefacts focused on a particular subjects and disciplines as part of teaching and learning efforts. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

        "abstract": "Medical imaging plays an important role in the early diagnosis of various diseases. In machine learning algorithms, texture, color, and shapefeatures areprimarily used. This may result in a system with inadequate model generalization capabilities. The development of an end-to-end model that can classify unprocessed medical images is now possible by recent advances in deep learning. The heavy demands of deep learning on memory and computer resources result in further advancement in the processing of complex data. As a result, quantum computing offerspotential solutions that take advantage of quantum mechanics concepts like entanglement, superposition,and interference. This chapter introduces a new medical image classification model based on the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN). Three benchmark datasets are used to evaluate the performance of QCNN; PneumoniaMNIST, VesselMNIST3D, and brain tumor MRI images. The experimental results showed that the proposed model based on the proposed QCNN is very promising. © 2023, IGI Global. All rights reserved.",

        "title": "Self-reporting with checklists in artificial intelligence research on medical imaging: a systematic review based on citations of CLAIM",
        "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the usage of a well-known and widely adopted checklist, Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical imaging (CLAIM), for self-reporting through a systematic analysis of its citations. Methods: Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus were used to search for citations (date, 29 April 2023). CLAIM’s use for self-reporting with proof (i.e., filled-out checklist) and other potential use cases were systematically assessed in research papers. Eligible papers were evaluated independently by two readers, with the help of automatic annotation. Item-by-item confirmation analysis on papers with checklist proof was subsequently performed. Results: A total of 391 unique citations were identified from three databases. Of the 118 papers included in this study, 12 (10%) provided a proof of self-reported CLAIM checklist. More than half (70; 59%) only mentioned some sort of adherence to CLAIM without providing any proof in the form of a checklist. Approximately one-third (36; 31%) cited the CLAIM for reasons unrelated to their reporting or methodological adherence. Overall, the claims on 57 to 93% of the items per publication were confirmed in the item-by-item analysis, with a mean and standard deviation of 81% and 10%, respectively. Conclusion: Only a small proportion of the publications used CLAIM as checklist and supplied filled-out documentation; however, the self-reported checklists may contain errors and should be approached cautiously. We hope that this systematic citation analysis would motivate artificial intelligence community about the importance of proper self-reporting, and encourage researchers, journals, editors, and reviewers to take action to ensure the proper usage of checklists. Clinical relevance statement: Only a small percentage of the publications used CLAIM for self-reporting with proof (i.e., filled-out checklist). However, the filled-out checklist proofs may contain errors, e.g., false claims of adherence, and should be approached cautiously. These may indicate inappropriate usage of checklists and necessitate further action by authorities. Key Points: • Of 118 eligible papers, only 12 (10%) followed the CLAIM checklist for self-reporting with proof (i.e., filled-out checklist). More than half (70; 59%) only mentioned some kind of adherence without providing any proof. • Overall, claims on 57 to 93% of the items were valid in item-by-item confirmation analysis, with a mean and standard deviation of 81% and 10%, respectively. • Even with the checklist proof, the items declared may contain errors and should be approached cautiously. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology.",

        "abstract": "Aim: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) can lead to short-term and long-term impairments in the fetus. The placenta functions as an exchanger for substance transport, playing a critical role in fetal growth. However, the mechanism from the placental standpoint is still not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms in the placenta that mediated the development of FGR and sex differences. Methods: We analyzed the gene expression profiles of GSE100415 containing specific normotensive FGR placental samples and GSE114691 with canonical samples using three different methods, differentially expressed gene analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis. Gene enrichment was performed, including the gene ontology and pathway from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The important process was then validated in pregnant Wistar rats subcutaneously administered dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg/d) or saline from gestation Day 9 to 21. Results: Our results revealed little difference between the comparison of normal and normotensive FGR placental samples but confirmed the sex difference. Further analyses of the canonical samples identified the occurrence of vascular dysfunction, which was validated by the calculation of the vascular lumen area, showing that the vascular lumen in the FGR group was more than in the control. We also discovered 17 significantly expressed genes from the involved eigengenes. Conclusion: Our study provides an important theoretical and experimental basis to reevaluate the development of FGR from the placental standpoint and suggests a series of biomarkers for future clinical use. © 2023 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a quantitative structure–property relationship model (QSPR) based on machine learning (ML) for a pyrimidine-pyrazole hybrid as a corrosion inhibitor. Based on the metric values of the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE), the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model was found to be the best predictive model for the N-heterocyclic dataset and its respective non-aggregated dataset. When the XGBoost model was applied to three additional pyrimidine-pyrazole hybrid derivatives, this consistency was also seen, and high corrosion inhibition efficiency (CIE) values were obtained ranging from 82.09% to 95.26%. According to the CIE trends found from the ML predictions, DFT calculations for these derivatives also reveal a strong and suitable adsorption energy trend ranging from −1.40 to −1.52 eV. Also supported by the compatibility of the energy gap trend with the CIE trend of the inhibitor molecule. This innovative method can elucidate the characteristics of potential organic corrosion inhibitors before conducting experimental research, which can speed up the preparation of fresh and strong organic corrosion inhibitors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Drug–target interactions (DTIs) are considered a crucial component of drug design and drug discovery. To date, many computational methods were developed for drug–target interactions, but they are insufficiently informative for accurately predicting DTIs due to the lack of experimentally verified negative datasets, inaccurate molecular feature representation, and ineffective DTI classifiers. Therefore, we address the limitations of randomly selecting negative DTI data from unknown drug–target pairs by establishing two experimentally validated datasets and propose a capsule network-based framework called CapBM-DTI to capture hierarchical relationships of drugs and targets, which adopts pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for contextual sequence feature extraction from target proteins through transfer learning and the message-passing neural network (MPNN) for the 2-D graph feature extraction of compounds to accurately and robustly identify drug–target interactions. We compared the performance of CapBM-DTI with state-of-the-art methods using four experimentally validated DTI datasets of different sizes, including human (Homo sapiens) and worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) species datasets, as well as three subsets (new compounds, new proteins, and new pairs). Our results demonstrate that the proposed model achieved robust performance and powerful generalization ability in all experiments. The case study on treating COVID-19 demonstrates the applicability of the model in virtual screening. © 2023 by the authors.",

        "abstract": "This study attempts to investigate how product attributes and consumer socio-economic status affect organic milk (OM) product ESG performance. There are not many pertinent studies on the interaction between the EGS evaluation system and organic milk products. Thus, this paper develops a targeted hedonic-regression model based on the EPB and ECB theories to investigate the ESG and sub-ESG impact of the above attributes based on the consumption dataset from Kantar Worldpanel. We also introduce the moderating variable of marketing resource intensity (MRI) to check the influencing mechanism of the sub-ESG rating index. This study demonstrates that the intensity of marketing resources has a moderating effect on the ESG performance of organic milk producers. Moreover, we also found evidence that the household’s family size and internal product attributes have a more significant impact on the ESG rating index. In addition, compared to social and governance information, the environmental information disclosure index has a more significant influence on consumers’ socio-economic status and product attributes compared with the social and governance rating index. This study not only contributes to deepening the understanding of the ESG evaluation system but also provides scientific guidance for the producers’ ESG strategy. Therefore, to increase the competitive advantage of OM enterprises, they should endeavor to construct a comprehensive evaluation system of entertainment social governance rating indexes and engage in environmental investment activities. © 2023 by the authors.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of using this algorithm through an extensive approach, comparing the performance of Grover's algorithm with classical machine learning algorithms. Our results reveal that the quantum algorithm offers significant improvements in prediction accuracy, enabling the identification of previously undetected PPIs.

        "title": "Genes for highly abundant proteins in Escherichia coli avoid 5’ codons that promote ribosomal initiation",
        "abstract": "In many species highly expressed genes (HEGs) over-employ the synonymous codons that match the more abundant iso-acceptor tRNAs. Bacterial transgene codon randomization experiments report, however, that enrichment with such “translationally optimal” codons has little to no effect on the resultant protein level. By contrast, consistent with the view that ribosomal initiation is rate limiting, synonymous codon usage following the 5’ ATG greatly influences protein levels, at least in part by modifying RNA stability. For the design of bacterial transgenes, for simple codon based in silico inference of protein levels and for understanding selection on synonymous mutations, it would be valuable to computationally determine initiation optimality (IO) scores for codons for any given species. One attractive approach is to characterize the 5’ codon enrichment of HEGs compared with the most lowly expressed genes, just as translational optimality scores of codons have been similarly defined employing the full gene body. Here we determine the viability of this approach employing a unique opportunity: for Escherichia coli there is both the most extensive protein abundance data for native genes and a unique large-scale transgene codon randomization experiment enabling objective definition of the 5’ codons that cause, rather than just correlate with, high protein abundance (that we equate with initiation optimality, broadly defined). Surprisingly, the 5’ ends of native genes that specify highly abundant proteins avoid such initiation optimal codons. We find that this is probably owing to conflicting selection pressures particular to native HEGs, including selection favouring low initiation rates, this potentially enabling high efficiency of ribosomal usage and low noise. While the classical HEG enrichment approach does not work, rendering simple prediction of native protein abundance from 5’ codon content futile, we report evidence that initiation optimality scores derived from the transgene experiment may hold relevance for in silico transgene design for a broad spectrum of bacteria. © 2023 Lewin et al.

        "title": "An ensemble machine learning based bank loan approval predictions system with a smart application",
        "abstract": "Banks rely heavily on loans as a primary source of revenue; however, distinguishing deserving applicants who will reliably repay loans presents an ongoing challenge. Conventional selection processes often struggle to identify the most suitable candidates from a pool of loan applicants. In response to this challenge, we present an innovative machine learning (ML) based loan prediction system designed to identify qualified loan applicants autonomously. This comprehensive study encompasses data preprocessing, effective data balancing using SMOTE, and the implementation of diverse ML models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and advanced deep learning models such as deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term memory models. The model's performance is rigorously assessed in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1_score. Our experimental analysis reveals that the Extra Trees outperforms its counterparts. Furthermore, we successfully predict bank loan defaulters through an ensemble voting model, which includes the top three ML models, achieving a remarkable 0.62% increase in accuracy compared to the Extra Trees. To facilitate user interaction, we have developed a user-friendly desktop-based application. Notably, our findings demonstrate that the voting-based ensemble model surpasses both individual ML models, including Extra Trees, and existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an impressive accuracy of 87.26%. This innovative system has the potential to significantly streamline and enhance the efficiency of bank loan approval processes, ultimately benefiting both financial institutions and loan applicants alike. © 2023 The Author(s)",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to design a multimodal teaching platform to facilitate users by learning oral Chinese as a Foreign language. The designed system intends to improve the oral learning experience, efficiency and fluency. Firstly, this paper describes the overall design of Chinese as a Foreign language system for speaking using a multimodal teaching mode. Secondly, it analyzes the architecture of the oral Chinese language as a Foreign language system by introducing specific functional modules and system processes. Thirdly, it uses the optimization algorithm of Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on fruit fly optimization to optimize the parameters by enhancing the degree of oral fluency of Chinese as a Foreign language, gradually accumulate the rules of oral learning, and complete the design of oral Chinese as a Foreign language system based on multimodal Teaching mode. Finally, it incorporates SVM and the improved SVM for Drosophila Algorithm (ISVM-DA) to optimize language learning by accurately classifying vocabulary and enhancing learning. The experimental results showed that the proposed system has the maximum Stability Ratio of 90%, substantial Sensitivity of 85%, and Recall values of 88% compared to existing systems by proving the good robustness of the system. The system designed in this paper can stimulate users’ interest in learning oral Chinese as a Foreign language and improve the efficiency and level of users’ learning oral Chinese as a Foreign language. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

        "abstract": "The rapid and accurate evaluation of oil and gas assets, specifically for new development projects, poses a significant challenge due to the various project types, limited data availability, brief periods for assessment and decision making, and constraints arising from varying contractual and taxation conditions, political stability, and societal factors. This study leverages the grading standards of the evaluation index system for new oil and gas field development projects, along with relevant mathematical theories and methods for project evaluation and optimization. We developed an asset evaluation approach for new oil and gas projects by analyzing the assets of six new oil and gas field development projects in Brazil. This analysis resulted in the grading and ranking of new projects, and we tested and demonstrated four asset optimization techniques. After a comparative analysis with conventional evaluation results, we established an oil and gas project asset optimization approach centered on the cloud model comprehensive evaluation and linear weighted ranking, exhibiting Kendall’s tau coefficient of 0.8667 with conventional methods. The findings suggest that the combination of the cloud model comprehensive evaluation method with the linear weighted ranking method can facilitate asset optimization for oil and gas field development projects, meeting the practical needs for fast selection among various new projects. Furthermore, this research offers a technical and theoretical foundation for rapid evaluation and decision making regarding new assets. © 2023 by the authors.",

Current ML/AI models are prone to accentuate racial disparities. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview of how AI/ML models perpetuate racial biases and how we can mitigate this situation. A narrative review of articles published in the medical literature on racial biases and the use of AI/ML models was undertaken. Current AI/ML models are built on homogenous clinical datasets that have a gross underrepresentation of historically disadvantages demographic groups, especially the ethno-racial minorities. The consequence of such AI/ML models is that they perform poorly when deployed on ethno-racial minorities thus further amplifying racial biases. Healthcare providers, policymakers, AI developers and all stakeholders should pay close attention to various steps in the pipeline of building AI/ML models and every effort must be made to establish algorithmic fairness to redress inequities. © 2023 The Authors.
