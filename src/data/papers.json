    "title": "Potential cyberbullying detection in social media platforms based on a multi-task learning framework",
    "abstract": "The proliferation of online violence has given rise to a spate of malignant incidents, necessitating a renewed focus on the identification of cyberbullying comments. Text classification lies at the heart of efforts to tackle this pernicious problem. The identification of cyberbullying comments presents unique challenges that call for innovative solutions. In contrast to traditional text classification tasks, cyberbullying comments are often accompanied by subtle and arbitrary expressions that can confound even the most sophisticated classification networks, resulting in low recognition accuracy and effectiveness. To address this challenge, a novel approach is proposed that leverages the BERT pre-training model for word embedding to retain the hidden semantic information in the text. Building on this foundation, the BiSRU++ model which combines attentional mecha-nisms is used to further extract contextual features of comments. A multi-task learning framework is employed for joint training of sentiment analysis and cyberbullying detection to improve the model's classification accuracy and generalization ability. The proposed model is no longer en-tirely reliant on a sensitive word dictionary, and experimental results demonstrate its ability to better understand semantic information compared to traditional models, facilitating the identification of potential online cyberbullying comments. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.",

    "title": "Automatic construction of classification dimensions by clustering texts based on common words",
    "abstract": "A way to efficiently manage large sets of texts is to construct multiple dimensions on texts and manage the texts from the dimensions. The key problem is to use a suitable representation model of text to classify texts into class trees representing dimensions. Traditional vector-based distance definitions are unsuitable to restrict the semantic relations between texts and measure the similarity of a set of more than two texts. Frequently occurred common words within a set of texts represent the texts but traditional frequent-term-set based text clustering approaches and the topic model are unsuitable for generating class trees on texts. This paper proposes an approach to using common words to represent texts and measuring the similarity of a class of texts by calculating the sum of the weights of common words of the class that indicate the common semantics of these texts. The idea is in line with the characteristics of human classification of texts. A bottom-up text clustering approach is proposed to construct class trees of texts. The common words of each class on the class trees are used as the label of the class to indicate the common semantics of the class and manage the texts of the class. Therefore, the approach can be used to construct multiple classification trees on texts. The experiments for evaluating the classification accuracy and the structure of the constructed class trees show that our approach is better than other clustering algorithms. A document summarization approach based on our approach reaches a good performance. © 2023",

    "title": "Hand gesture classification framework leveraging the entropy features from sEMG signals and VMD augmented multi-class SVM",
    "abstract": "To improve the classification accuracy of hand movements from sEMG signals, this paper puts forward a unified hand gesture classification framework which exploits the potentials of variational mode decomposition (VMD) and multi-class support vector machine (SVM). Acquiring the sEMG signals from 25 intact subjects for ten functional activities in real-time, we implement a non-recursive adaptive decomposition technique to sEMG signals and perform power spectral analysis to identify the dominant narrow-band intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) that contain prominent biomarkers. Subsequently, to compute the optimal feature vectors from a set of entropy measures, this work investigates the performance of two techniques namely minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (MRMR) technique and kernel principal component analysis (kPCA). After extracting the optimal set of entropy features, the proposed approach implements a multi-class SVM based on one-vs-one (OVO) strategy to classify the hand gestures. The performance of the multi-class SVM compared with those of the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and naïve bayes (NB) classifiers highlight that multi-class SVM offers superior performance with an average classification accuracy of 99.98%. Moreover, for statistical analysis of the experimental results, this work performs Friedman test to analyze the significance of the SVM, KNN and NB classifier performances. Finally, the performance comparison of the proposed approach with those of the state-of-the-art techniques highlights the superiority of the proposed framework to improve the hand gesture classification accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "abstract": "Rough set theory has revolutionized data analysis by exploring and extracting valuable insights from imprecise data. The concept of Pythagorean fuzzy sets is a relatively novel mathematical framework in the fuzzy family with a higher ability to deal with imprecision embedded in decision making. Both theories can be combined to develop a broader Pythagorean fuzzy rough numbers for maximum benefit. The CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) and REGIME methods have appeared as successful methods for estimating the weights of criteria and ranking alternatives, respectively, in the field of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). In this study, our main objective is to develop a new methodology based on Pythagorean fuzzy rough numbers by integrating CRITIC and REGIME methodologies for the first time. The proposed Pythagorean fuzzy rough CRITIC-REGIME methodology (PFR-CRITIC-REGIME) is implemented to solve the sustainable supply chain problem of an electric ferry in public transit. The proposed method is thoroughly compared with some other existing decision making methods. The results of these evaluations are shown very reliable results.

    "title": "Optimal Resilient Tracking Control for Networked Systems With Multichannels Under Attacks",
    "abstract": "This article is concerned with the problem of resilient output tracking control for a class of discrete-time linear cyber-physical systems (CPSs) subject to denial-of-service attacks. The remote information exchange between the sensor and controller in CPSs employs a multichannel network because of its inherent advantages of resistance to destruction as well as to attacks. In order to design defense strategies to mitigate the negative impact of network attacks on the tracking performance of CPSs, considering the goals and energy constraints of both sides, the interaction process between them is modeled as a zero-sum stochastic game. Then, the Nash equilibrium of the problem is found with the help of the proposed Q-learning algorithm through an artfully designed state-based adaptive one-stage reward function. On the basis of the obtained optimal mixed strategy, the resilient output tracking controller is designed. Different from the work focusing on remote state estimation by means of game theory, this study makes the first effort to design a resilient output tracking control algorithm for CPSs with multiple channels using a stochastic game approach. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed resilient controller with the optimal defense strategy is validated on a renewable energy generation system prototype by extensive case studies.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.",

    "title": "Multi-scale Perception and Feature Refinement Network for multi-class segmentation of intracerebral hemorrhage in CT images",
    "abstract": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) poses a severe threat to human health and well-being. Automatic segmentation of hematomas in CT images can provide essential diagnostic assistance to physicians, and ensure improved treatment and recovery outcomes for patients. Existing methods for intracerebral hemorrhage segmentation mainly focus on identifying hemorrhage areas, without the ability to accurately distinguish and outline different types of hematomas. However, different types of hemorrhage exhibit a high degree of similarity in terms of gray matter level and shape, and the scale of hematomas can vary significantly. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-scale Perception and Feature Refinement Network (MPFR-Net) for automatic segmentation of both intraparenchymal and intraventricular hemorrhages. Specifically, we propose a Multi-scale Perception Module (MPM), which consists of the integration of features at different levels and the local and global multi-scale branches. MPM allows for the efficient extraction of multi-scale features and the establishment of long-range relationships between the target and background. Additionally, we propose a Feature Refinement Module (FRM) to refine fuzzy detail information that has been lost after down-sampling to the deep layer, while simultaneously supplementing the small target information from shallow features. To improve the clinical adaptability of our method, we further collect 608 patient cases from multiple hospitals to construct a multi-center dataset, termed as ICH-Seg in which each case contains both intraparenchymal and intraventricular hemorrhages. From the quantitative and visual results, MPFR-Net outperforms previous methods on both private and public datasets, showing promising segmentation for intracerebral hemorrhage and potential clinical applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "title": "A parallel-hierarchical neural network (PHNN) for motor imagery EEG signal classification",
    "abstract": "Motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) play a crucial role in fields such as robot control and stroke rehabilitation. With the flourishing development of deep learning, there has been a continuous emergence of motor imagery deep learning models with higher decoding accuracy. Activation of specific brain regions, such as the motor regions in the frontal and parietal lobes, carries information about motor imagery. However, most studies only extract features from the entire brain region, neglecting the potential features of specific brain regions. This may lead to poorer decoding performance. Therefore, this article proposes a parallel-hierarchical neural network (PHNN), which implements a hierarchical approach to feature learning from brain region level to multi-level fusion. Learning at the brain region level mainly explores the key information of specific brain regions (region-level) and the overall features of the entire brain (global-level), to obtain region-level features (RLF) and global-level features (GLF). Furthermore, given that region-level features contain crucial information within specific brain regions, multi-level fusion is employed to capture and fully utilize the differences and connections between the RLF and GLF, resulting in more discriminative multi-level fusion features (MLFF). We evaluate the model performance on the publicly available BCI Competition IV-2a dataset and High Gamma dataset, achieving recognition accuracies of 84.67% and 94.02%, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "title": "Feasibility and reproducibility of semi-automated longitudinal strain analysis: a comparative study with conventional manual strain analysis",
    "abstract": "Background: Conventional approach to myocardial strain analysis relies on a software designed for the left ventricle (LV) which is complex and time-consuming and is not specific for right ventricular (RV) and left atrial (LA) assessment. This study compared this conventional manual approach to strain evaluation with a novel semi-automatic analysis of myocardial strain, which is also chamber-specific. Methods: Two experienced observers used the AutoStrain software and manual QLab analysis to measure the LV, RV and LA strains in 152 healthy volunteers. Fifty cases were randomly selected for timing evaluation. Results: No significant differences in LV global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) were observed between the two methods (-21.0% ± 2.5% vs. -20.8% ± 2.4%, p = 0.230). Conversely, RV longitudinal free wall strain (RVFWS) and LA longitudinal strain during the reservoir phase (LASr) measured by the semi-automatic software differed from the manual analysis (RVFWS: -26.4% ± 4.8% vs. -31.3% ± 5.8%, p < 0.001; LAS: 48.0% ± 10.0% vs. 37.6% ± 9.9%, p < 0.001). Bland–Altman analysis showed a mean error of 0.1%, 4.9%, and 10.5% for LVGLS, RVFWS, and LASr, respectively, with limits of agreement of -2.9,2.6%, -8.1,17.9%, and -12.3,33.3%, respectively. The semi-automatic method had a significantly shorter strain analysis time compared with the manual method. Conclusions: The novel semi-automatic strain analysis has the potential to improve efficiency in measurement of longitudinal myocardial strain. It shows good agreement with manual analysis for LV strain measurement. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "title": "A Novel Similarity Measure Based on Accuracy Score of Conventional Type of Trapezoidal-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets and Its Applications in Multi-criteria Decision-Making Problems",
    "abstract": "The article aims to investigate the distance measure between any two conventional type trapezoidal-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (CTrVIFSs) whose membership and non-membership grades of an element are expressed as conventional trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (CTrIFN). Using the proposed distance measure, the similarity measure of CTrVIFSs is determined and its efficiency is shown by applying it to pattern recognition problems and MCDM problems. The similarity measure propounded in this article can be used to tackle real-world problems involving CTrVIFS as parameters, such as clustering, machine learning, and DNA matching. The application section discusses that this research can help decision-makers to recognize patterns and categorize samples with those patterns. Furthermore, the model of a real-world problem is given which utilizes the suggested similarity measure to solve MCDM problems, demonstrate the usability of the new technique and comprehend its applied intelligence above other methods. Finally, a general conclusion and future scope on this topic are discussed. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) is a relatively new medical imaging modality that exploits an area of diagnostic potential formerly untouched. Although exploratory translational and clinical studies exist, no surgical HSI datasets are openly accessible to the general scientific community. To address this bottleneck, this publication releases HeiPorSPECTRAL (https://www.heiporspectral.org ; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7737674), the first annotated high-quality standardized surgical HSI dataset. It comprises 5,758 spectral images acquired with the TIVITA® Tissue and annotated with 20 physiological porcine organs from 8 pigs per organ distributed over a total number of 11 pigs. Each HSI image features a resolution of 480 × 640 pixels acquired over the 500–1000 nm wavelength range. The acquisition protocol has been designed such that the variability of organ spectra as a function of several parameters including the camera angle and the individual can be assessed. A comprehensive technical validation confirmed both the quality of the raw data and the annotations. We envision potential reuse within this dataset, but also its reuse as baseline data for future research questions outside this dataset. Sus scrofa. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "title": "Fast and accurate object detector for autonomous driving based on improved YOLOv5",
    "abstract": "Autonomous driving is an important branch of artificial intelligence, and real-time and accurate object detection is key to ensuring the safe and stable operation of autonomous vehicles. To this end, this paper proposes a fast and accurate object detector for autonomous driving based on improved YOLOv5. First, the YOLOv5 algorithm is improved by using structural re-parameterization (Rep), enhancing the accuracy and speed of the model through training-inference decoupling. Additionally, the neural architecture search method is introduced to cut redundant branches in the multi-branch re-parameterization module during the training phase, which ameliorates the training efficiency and accuracy. Finally, a small object detection layer is added to the network and the coordinate attention mechanism is added to all detection layers to improve the recognition rate of the model for small vehicles and pedestrians. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed method on the KITTI dataset reaches 96.1%, and the FPS reaches 202, which is superior to many current mainstream algorithms and effectively improves the accuracy and real-time performance of unmanned driving object detection. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "title": "Improved discrete salp swarm algorithm using exploration and exploitation techniques for feature selection in intrusion detection systems",
    "abstract": "The salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is a well-known optimization algorithm that is increasingly being utilized to solve many sorts of optimization problems. However, SSA may converge to sub-optimal solutions when it is applied to discrete problems such as the feature selection (FS) problem. This paper presents the enhanced opposition-based learning salp swarm algorithm (EOSSA), which is an improved SSA algorithm for solving the FS problem in intrusion detection systems (IDS). EOSSA incorporates four improvements into the original SSA algorithm. Firstly, the opposition-based learning (OBL) method is used in the initialization step of SSA to boost its population diversity. Secondly, the Elite opposition-based learning (EOBL) is used in the improvement loop of SSA to improve its exploration ability. Third, a variable neighborhood search (VNS) method is used in the improvement loop of SSA to improve its exploration mechanism to improve the local search space. Lastly, the Sigmoid binary transform function is used to convert the continuous candidate solutions produced by SSA into discrete binary solutions. EOSSA was evaluated against eighteen popular optimization algorithms (e.g., improved salp swarm algorithm based on opposition-based learning (ISSA), SSA, particle swarm algorithm (PSO), cuckoo search (CS), bat algorithm (BA), and Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO)) using eleven popular intrusion detection datasets (CICIDS2017, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CICDDOS2019, CIRA-CIC-DoH, Intrusion detection 2018, UNSW-NB15, NSL-KDD, Phishing Legitimate, Malmem2022, IoT, and LUFlow Network) to Detect IoT Botnet Attacks. Moreover, EOSSA was compared with four machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN)). The overall simulation results suggested that the proposed method is superior to the other algorithms in terms of the accuracy and number of selected features. The statistical analysis of the simulation results using the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirms the superiority of the proposed method. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "title": "KATZNCP: a miRNA–disease association prediction model integrating KATZ algorithm and network consistency projection",
    "abstract": "Background: Clinical studies have shown that miRNAs are closely related to human health. The study of potential associations between miRNAs and diseases will contribute to a profound understanding of the mechanism of disease development, as well as human disease prevention and treatment. MiRNA–disease associations predicted by computational methods are the best complement to biological experiments. Results: In this research, a federated computational model KATZNCP was proposed on the basis of the KATZ algorithm and network consistency projection to infer the potential miRNA–disease associations. In KATZNCP, a heterogeneous network was initially constructed by integrating the known miRNA–disease association, integrated miRNA similarities, and integrated disease similarities; then, the KATZ algorithm was implemented in the heterogeneous network to obtain the estimated miRNA–disease prediction scores. Finally, the precise scores were obtained by the network consistency projection method as the final prediction results. KATZNCP achieved the reliable predictive performance in leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) with an AUC value of 0.9325, which was better than the state-of-the-art comparable algorithms. Furthermore, case studies of lung neoplasms and esophageal neoplasms demonstrated the excellent predictive performance of KATZNCP. Conclusion: A new computational model KATZNCP was proposed for predicting potential miRNA–drug associations based on KATZ and network consistency projections, which can effectively predict the potential miRNA–disease interactions. Therefore, KATZNCP can be used to provide guidance for future experiments. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "title": "Artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of dental diseases on panoramic radiographs: a preliminary study",
    "abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced to interpret the panoramic radiographs (PRs). The aim of this study was to develop an AI framework to diagnose multiple dental diseases on PRs, and to initially evaluate its performance. Methods: The AI framework was developed based on 2 deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), BDU-Net and nnU-Net. 1996 PRs were used for training. Diagnostic evaluation was performed on a separate evaluation dataset including 282 PRs. Sensitivity, specificity, Youden’s index, the area under the curve (AUC), and diagnostic time were calculated. Dentists with 3 different levels of seniority (H: high, M: medium, L: low) diagnosed the same evaluation dataset independently. Mann-Whitney U test and Delong test were conducted for statistical analysis (ɑ=0.05). Results: Sensitivity, specificity, and Youden’s index of the framework for diagnosing 5 diseases were 0.964, 0.996, 0.960 (impacted teeth), 0.953, 0.998, 0.951 (full crowns), 0.871, 0.999, 0.870 (residual roots), 0.885, 0.994, 0.879 (missing teeth), and 0.554, 0.990, 0.544 (caries), respectively. AUC of the framework for the diseases were 0.980 (95%CI: 0.976–0.983, impacted teeth), 0.975 (95%CI: 0.972–0.978, full crowns), and 0.935 (95%CI: 0.929–0.940, residual roots), 0.939 (95%CI: 0.934–0.944, missing teeth), and 0.772 (95%CI: 0.764–0.781, caries), respectively. AUC of the AI framework was comparable to that of all dentists in diagnosing residual roots (p > 0.05), and its AUC values were similar to (p > 0.05) or better than (p < 0.05) that of M-level dentists for diagnosing 5 diseases. But AUC of the framework was statistically lower than some of H-level dentists for diagnosing impacted teeth, missing teeth, and caries (p < 0.05). The mean diagnostic time of the framework was significantly shorter than that of all dentists (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The AI framework based on BDU-Net and nnU-Net demonstrated high specificity on diagnosing impacted teeth, full crowns, missing teeth, residual roots, and caries with high efficiency. The clinical feasibility of AI framework was preliminary verified since its performance was similar to or even better than the dentists with 3–10 years of experience. However, the AI framework for caries diagnosis should be improved. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "title": "A study on computer vision for facial emotion recognition",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has been successfully applied in various fields, one of which is computer vision. In this study, a deep neural network (DNN) was adopted for Facial emotion recognition (FER). One of the objectives in this study is to identify the critical facial features on which the DNN model focuses for FER. In particular, we utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN), the combination of squeeze-and-excitation network and the residual neural network, for the task of FER. We utilized AffectNet and the Real-World Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB) as the facial expression databases that provide learning samples for the CNN. The feature maps were extracted from the residual blocks for further analysis. Our analysis shows that the features around the nose and mouth are critical facial landmarks for the neural networks. Cross-database validations were conducted between the databases. The network model trained on AffectNet achieved 77.37% accuracy when validated on the RAF-DB, while the network model pretrained on AffectNet and then transfer learned on the RAF-DB results in validation accuracy of 83.37%. The outcomes of this study would improve the understanding of neural networks and assist with improving computer vision accuracy. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "title": "Explanation matters: An experimental study on explainable AI",
    "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an important advance in the field of machine learning to shed light on black box algorithms and thus a promising approach to improving artificial intelligence (AI) adoption. While previous literature has already addressed the technological benefits of XAI, there has been little research on XAI from the user’s perspective. Building upon the theory of trust, we propose a model that hypothesizes that post hoc explainability (using Shapley Additive Explanations) has a significant impact on use-related variables in this context. To test our model, we designed an experiment using a randomized controlled trial design where participants compare signatures and detect forged signatures. Surprisingly, our study shows that XAI only has a small but significant impact on perceived explainability. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that a high level of perceived explainability has a strong impact on important constructs including trust and perceived usefulness. A post hoc analysis shows that hedonic factors are significantly related to perceived explainability and require more attention in future research. We conclude with important directions for academia and for organizations. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "title": "Exploring educational impacts among pre, during and post COVID-19 lockdowns from students with different personality traits",
    "abstract": "The influence of personality traits on educational outcomes has been widely recognized and studied. Research has explored its effects on factors such as student satisfaction, academic anxiety, and dishonesty, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there has been a lack of studies comparing the learning behaviors and performance of students with different personality traits during the pre, during, and post-COVID-19 lockdown periods. This study fills this gap by analyzing the differences in academic metrics, such as class grades and assignment submissions, among students with varying personality traits during different lockdown periods. Our research, based on a dataset of 282 graduate students in the USA, identified correlations and patterns between lockdown periods, personality traits, and academic metrics. For example, the class grades and the rate of late submissions were affected by different lockdown periods. Students with lower degree in extraversion and agreeableness made less attempts in assignment submissions. These findings can assist educators in identifying impacted students and developing effective teaching strategies at early stage in future incidents. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "title": "Small files access efficiency in hadoop distributed file system a case study performed on British library text files",
    "abstract": "In today’s world storing a large amount of data, large datasets, handling data in various forms is a challenging task. Data is getting produced rapidly with major small sized files. Hadoop is the solution for the big data problem except few limitations. This method is suggested to provide a better one for small file sizes in terms of storage, access effectiveness, and time. In contrast to the current methods, such as HDFS sequence files, HAR, and NHAR, a revolutionary strategy called VFS-HDFS architecture is created with the goal of optimizing small-sized files access problems. In HDFS When a user requests any file, the client will communicate to NameNode and NameNode will revert in the form of metadata of the file. The metadata contains the information about the blocks and locations. When the client gets this metadata information of a particular file, it communicates with the DataNodes and accesses the data sequentially. In the proposed work caching is introduced to store all the files. When a user requests for an existing file, the data will be retrieved from the cache itself preventing revisiting the NameNode followed by the DataNodes, which reduces the time improving access efficiency. Classification is used to classify the files as per their category and Bucket per category file table holds the metadata of the individual category wise container. The existing HDFS architecture has been wrapped with a virtual file system layer in the proposed development. However, the research is done without changing the HFDS architecture. Using this proposed system, better results are obtained in terms of access efficiency of small sized files in HDFS. A case study is performed on the British Library datasets on.txt and.rtf files. The proposed system can be used to enhance the library if the catalogue is categorized as per their category in a container reducing the storage, improving the access efficiency at the cost of memory. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "title": "Predicting oral cancer risk in patients with oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid mucositis using machine learning",
    "abstract": "Oral cancer may arise from oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid mucositis (oral lichen planus and oral lichenoid lesions) subtypes of oral potentially malignant disorders. As not all patients will develop oral cancer in their lifetime, the availability of malignant transformation predictive platforms would assist in the individualized treatment planning and formulation of optimal follow-up regimens for these patients. Therefore, this study aims to compare and select optimal machine learning (ML)-based models for stratifying the malignant transformation status of patients with oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid mucositis. One thousand one hundred and eighty-seven patients with oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid mucositis treated at three tertiary health institutions in Hong Kong, Newcastle UK, and Lagos Nigeria were included in the study. Demographic, clinical, pathological, and treatment-based factors obtained at diagnosis and during follow-up were used to populate and compare forty-six machine learning-based models. These were implemented as a set of twenty-six predictors for centers with substantial data quantity and fifteen predictors for centers with insufficient data. Two best models were selected according to the number of variables. We found that the optimal ML-based risk models with twenty-six and fifteen predictors achieved an accuracy of 97% and 94% respectively following model testing. Upon external validation, both models achieved a sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score of 1, 0.88, and 0.67 on consecutive patients treated after the construction of the models. Furthermore, the 15-predictor ML model for centers with reduced data achieved a higher sensitivity for identifying oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid mucositis patients that developed malignancies in other treatment settings compared to the binary oral epithelial dysplasia system for risk stratification (0.96 vs 0.82). These findings suggest that machine learning-based models could be useful potentially to stratify patients with oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid mucositis according to their risk of malignant transformation in different settings. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "title": "Different effects of cardiometabolic syndrome on brain age in relation to gender and ethnicity",
    "abstract": "Background: A growing body of evidence shows differences in the prevalence of cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS) and dementia based on gender and ethnicity. However, there is a paucity of information about ethnic- and gender-specific CMS effects on brain age. We investigated the different effects of CMS on brain age by gender in Korean and British cognitively unimpaired (CU) populations. We also determined whether the gender-specific difference in the effects of CMS on brain age changes depending on ethnicity. Methods: These analyses used de-identified, cross-sectional data on CU populations from Korea and United Kingdom (UK) that underwent brain MRI. After propensity score matching to balance the age and gender between the Korean and UK populations, 5759 Korean individuals (3042 males and 2717 females) and 9903 individuals from the UK (4736 males and 5167 females) were included in this study. Brain age index (BAI), calculated by the difference between the predicted brain age by the algorithm and the chronological age, was considered as main outcome and presence of CMS, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, obesity, and underweight was considered as a predictor. Gender (males and females) and ethnicity (Korean and UK) were considered as effect modifiers. Results: The presence of T2DM and hypertension was associated with a higher BAI regardless of gender and ethnicity (p < 0.001), except for hypertension in Korean males (p = 0.309). Among Koreans, there were interaction effects of gender and the presence of T2DM (p for T2DM*gender = 0.035) and hypertension (p for hypertension*gender = 0.046) on BAI in Koreans, suggesting that T2DM and hypertension are each associated with a higher BAI in females than in males. In contrast, among individuals from the UK, there were no differences in the effects of T2DM (p for T2DM*gender = 0.098) and hypertension (p for hypertension*gender = 0.203) on BAI between males and females. Conclusions: Our results highlight gender and ethnic differences as important factors in mediating the effects of CMS on brain age. Furthermore, these results suggest that ethnic- and gender-specific prevention strategies may be needed to protect against accelerated brain aging. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "title": "Palatal myoclonus and hypertrophic olivary degeneration following wernekinck commissure syndrome: a case report",
    "abstract": "Background: Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD), a rare form of transsynaptic degeneration, is secondary to dentato-rubro-olivary pathway injuries in some cases. We describe a unique case of an HOD patient who presented with palatal myoclonus secondary to Wernekinck commissure syndrome caused by a rare bilateral “heart-shaped” infarct lesion in the midbrain. Case presentation: A 49-year-old man presented with progressive gait instability in the past 7 months. The patient had a history of posterior circulation ischemic stroke presenting with diplopia, slurred speech, and difficulty in swallowing and walking 3 years prior to admission. The symptoms improved after treatment. The feeling of imbalance appeared and was aggravated gradually in the past 7 months. Neurological examination demonstrated dysarthria, horizontal nystagmus, bilateral cerebellar ataxia, and 2–3 Hz rhythmic contractions of the soft palate and upper larynx. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain performed 3 years prior to this admission showed an acute midline lesion in the midbrain exhibiting a remarkable “heart appearance” on diffusion weighted imaging. MRI after this admission revealed T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity with hypertrophy of the bilateral inferior olivary nucleus. We considered a diagnosis of HOD resulting from a midbrain heart-shaped infarction, which caused Wernekinck commissure syndrome 3 years prior to admission and later HOD. Adamantanamine and B vitamins were administered for neurotrophic treatment. Rehabilitation training was also performed. One year later, the symptoms of this patient were neither improved nor aggravated. Conclusion: This case report suggests that patients with a history of midbrain injury, especially Wernekinck commissure injury, should be alert to the possibility of delayed bilateral HOD when new symptoms occur or original symptoms are aggravated. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Robust, generalizable approaches to identify compounds efficiently with undesirable mechanisms of action in complex cellular assays remain elusive. Such a process would be useful for hit triage during high-throughput screening and, ultimately, predictive toxicology during drug development. Here we generate cell painting and cellular health profiles for 218 prototypical cytotoxic and nuisance compounds in U-2 OS cells in a concentration-response format. A diversity of compounds that cause cellular damage produces bioactive cell painting morphologies, including cytoskeletal poisons, genotoxins, nonspecific electrophiles, and redox-active compounds. Further, we show that lower quality lysine acetyltransferase inhibitors and nonspecific electrophiles can be distinguished from more selective counterparts. We propose that the purposeful inclusion of cytotoxic and nuisance reference compounds such as those profiled in this resource will help with assay optimization and compound prioritization in complex cellular assays like cell painting. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence methods (AI) have been widely applied in building energy consumption prediction. As data-intensive methods, lacking sufficient input features will significantly impede prediction performance. For some buildings where the building energy management systems (BEMs) are underperformed, limited information can be extracted. In this study, a feature engineering framework that combines feature construction and selection was developed to deal with limited feature problems. Empirical mode decomposition and Boruta feature selection were applied with the purpose of generating new informative features and selecting all relevant features, respectively. The proposed strategy was then tested using some popular machine learning algorithms for three different buildings. The results indicated that the proposed strategy was able to extend the feature dimensions and determine all relevant features from the extended feature space, which resulted to a significant improvement in the prediction performance. Unlike most other existing studies whereby observed performance enhancements may be marginal and restricted to few of the tested algorithms, the features selected here consistently improved the outcomes of all the machine learning algorithms tested for all 3 buildings. © 2023 The Author(s)",

    "title": "AI-ERA: Artificial Intelligence-Empowered Resource Allocation for LoRa-Enabled IoT Applications",
    "abstract": "Adaptive data rate (ADR) is a widely adopted resource assignment approach in long-range wide-area networks (LoRaWANs) for static Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as smart grids and metering. Blind ADR (BADR) has been recommended for mobile IoT applications such as pet and industrial asset tracking. However, ADR and BADR cannot provide appropriate measures to alleviate the massive packet loss problem caused by the unsuitable spreading factors (SFs) assigned to end devices when they are mobile. This article proposes a novel proactive approach - 'artificial intelligence-empowered resource allocation' (AI-ERA) - to address the resource assignment issue in static and mobile IoT applications. The AI-ERA approach consists of two modes, namely offline and online modes. First, a deep neural network (DNN) model is trained with a dataset generated at ns-3 in the offline mode. Second, the proposed AI-ERA approach utilizes the pretrained DNN model in the online mode to proactively assign an efficient SF for the end device before each uplink packet transmission. The proactive behavior of the AI-ERA improved the packet success ratio by an average of 32% and 28% in static and mobility scenarios compared with the typical LoRaWAN ADR, respectively.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a 3-PRS (prismatic, revolute, and spherical) parallel manipulator for platform stabilization is designed. The main purpose of this device is to stabilize visual equipment, which is placed on top of a car to inspect electrical transmission cables, as part of routine maintenance. Due to the bulky and heavy infrared cameras used during inspections, a stabilizer platform has been designed to handle the weight of camera equipment up to 10 kg. This device consists of two major mechanisms. The first mechanism is able to adjust the angle of the camera. Thus, the user can focus the camera along the electric transmission lines. The second mechanism is stabilization. The mechanism serves to stabilize the orientation and position of the camera in the roll, pitch, and heave directions. To test the performance of the stabilization mechanism, the device is fed with the known value of the angle with regard to the input. As such, the device is trying to compensate for the change in angle. The results show that the errors between the input angles and compensated angles are in the range of 0.4–3%. Errors are seen to be within an acceptable range. It is significant that the resultant errors do not affect the orientation of the camera. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Using Taguchi's method, the best heat transfer locations for the heating and cooling systems are optimized. To investigate the flow field and heat transfer, the double multi-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann method is used. Sixteen different positions for heating and cooling systems are investigated, the full factorial method for the proposed model considers 4 4= 256 experiments, but using the Taguchi method can significantly reduce the number of experiments. In this study, with respect to the number of parameters and levels, the orthogonal array L16 of Taguchi's method is proposed which reduces the number of experiments to 16. Various simulations are performed based on the design of the experiments, and the process output changes are measured by a factor called the signal-to-noise ratio. The optimal positions of the heating and cooling systems to maximize and minimize the Nusselt number are found. Also, using analysis of variance (ANOVA), the effective parameters and the percentage of participation of each of them on the Nusselt number are evaluated. In addition, the results show that the height position of the heating system has the greatest effect on the Nusselt number, while the longitudinal position of the cooling system has the least effect. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shiraz University.",

    "abstract": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a common cause of death in individuals older than 55 years. Although younger individuals are less frequently seen with ACS, this clinical event has increasing incidence trends, shows high recurrence rates and triggers considerable economic burden. Young individuals with ACS (yACS) are usually underrepresented and show idiosyncratic epidemiologic features compared to older subjects. These differences may justify why available risk prediction models usually penalize yACS with higher false positive rates compared to older subjects. We hypothesized that exploring temporal framing structures such as prediction time, observation windows and subgroup-specific prediction, could improve time-dependent prediction metrics. Among individuals who have experienced ACS (nglobal_cohort = 6341 and nyACS = 2242), the predictive accuracy for adverse clinical events was optimized by using specific rules for yACS and splitting short-term and long-term prediction windows, leading to the detection of 80% of events, compared to 69% by using a rule designed for the global cohort. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Protoplast fusion is one of the most reliable methods of introducing desirable traits into industrially-promising fungal strains. It harnesses the entire genomic repertoire of fusing microorganisms by routing the natural barrier and genetic incompatibility between them. In the present study, the axenic culture of a thermo-halotolerant strain of Aspergillus candidus (Asp-C) produced an anti-leukemic l-asparaginase (l-ASNase) while a xylan-degrading strain of Aspergillus sydowii (Asp-S) produced the acrylamide-reduction type. Protoplast fusion of the wild strains generated Fusant-06 with improved anti-leukemic and acrylamide reduction potentials. Submerged fed-batch fermentation was preferred to batch and continuous modes on the basis of impressive techno-economics. Fusant-06 l-ASNase was purified by PEG/Na+ citrate aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) to 146.21-fold and global sensitivity analysis report revealed polymer molecular weight and citrate concentration as major determinants of yield and purification factor, respectively. The enzyme was characterized by molecular weight, amino acid profile, activity and stability to chemical agents. Michaelis–Menten kinetics, evaluated under optimum conditions gave Km, Vmax, Kcat, and Kcat/Km as 6.67 × 10–5 M, 1666.67 µmolmin−1 mg−1 protein, 3.88 × 104 min−1 and 5.81 × 108 M−1.min−1 respectively. In-vitro cytotoxicity of HL-60 cell lines by Fusant-06 l-ASNase improved significantly from their respective wild strains. Stability of Fusant-06 l-ASNase over a wide range of pH, temperature and NaCl concentration, coupled with its micromolar Km value, confers commercial and therapeutic value on the product. Free-radical scavenging and acrylamide reduction activities were intermediate and the conferred thermo-halo-stability could be exploited for sustainable clinical and food industry applications. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "title": "Learning-based physical models of room-temperature semiconductor detectors with reduced data",
    "abstract": "Room-temperature semiconductor radiation detectors (RTSD) have broad applications in medical imaging, homeland security, astrophysics and others. RTSDs such as CdZnTe, CdTe are often pixelated, and characterization of these detectors at micron level can benefit 3-D event reconstruction at sub-pixel level. Material defects alongwith electron and hole charge transport properties need to be characterized which requires several experimental setups and is labor intensive. The current state-of-art approaches characterize each detector pixel, considering the detector in bulk. In this article, we propose a new microscopic learning-based physical models of RTSD based on limited data compared to what is dictated by the physical equations. Our learning models uses a physical charge transport considering trapping centers. Our models learn these material properties in an indirect manner from the measurable signals at the electrodes and/or free and/or trapped charges distributed in the RTSD for electron–hole charge pair injections in the material. Based on the amount of data used during training our physical model, our algorithm characterizes the detector for charge drifts, trapping, detrapping and recombination coefficients considering multiple trapping centers or as a single equivalent trapping center. The RTSD is segmented into voxels spatially, and in each voxel, the material properties are modeled as learnable parameters. Depending on the amount of data, our models can characterize the RTSD either completely or in an equivalent manner. © 2022, The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "In this study, the relationship between the operating conditions and the product yields and a control framework of the hydrocracking process was developed. The data were collected from a hydrocracking unit in a Chinese refinery. Principal component analysis was used to decrease the number of input variables. Then support vector machine, Gaussian process regression (GPR), and decision tree regression models were developed to establish the relationship above. The best model is GPR, whose Pearson correlation coefficient between the prediction value and the actual value is greater than 0.97 for all the product yields. Shapley additive explanations were performed to interpret the results of the GPR models. A control framework of the hydrocracking unit was then proposed based on the results above. The results show that the machine learning method is a valuable tool for predicting the yield of hydrocracking products, and the control framework proposed helps optimize hydrocracking product yields. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Quick Response (QR) codes in various applications, particularly in sensitive domains like banking and financial transactions, necessitates robust data protection measures. Visual cryptography techniques are used to encode confidential information into multiple shares called shadows, which are communicated to the receivers. The receiving side decodes the shadows by stacking them together physically or digitally. In this research, an innovative solution titled “Error-induced inverse pixel visual cryptography (EIIPVC) for secure QR code communication” is proposed to enhance the security. The proposed EIIPVC leverages complementary shadows and introduces controlled errors during the sharing process. This feature makes it exceedingly challenging for potential malpractice to access or tamper with the data, ensuring a higher level of security. In this research, a single grayscale secret source (GSS) image in the form of QR code is used. This research also contributes to improving traditional issues, such as the quality of the reconstructed image and pixel expansion. The experimental results demonstrate that the EIIPVC approach significantly ensures enhanced security, safeguarding the transmitted data against potential attacks. The quality of the reconstructed image is improved by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) value up to 5%, indicating its superiority in preserving the visual clarity. © 2023 by author(s).",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel efficient inspired algorithm based on snow avalanches in nature which is named the Snow Avalanches Algorithm (SAA), for solving the benchmark and engineering optimization problems and determining the global solution. The proposed algorithm is modeled using four phases including avalanche due to mountain slope, human factors, weather in the region as well as normal conditions and it has only one control parameter. The advantages of this algorithm are low control parameters, simple structure and also easy implementation. The effectiveness of the SAA algorithm is examined on 23 classic benchmark test functions. Then, the effectiveness of the SAA to achieve accurate results in different aspects is examined and proved on engineering problems including six different cases. The superiority of the SAA to solve the classic benchmark test functions is compared with spotted hyena optimization (SHO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), Aquila optimizer (AO), differential evolution (DE), bat algorithm (BA), dwarf mongoose optimization (DMO), genetic algorithm (GA), artificial bee colony (ABC), and ant colony optimization (ACO). The simulation results provide evidence for the well-organized and efficient performance of the SAA in solving a great diversity of engineering problems. The results demonstrated that the SAA can be more effective than other algorithms to solve the test functions in terms of optimization accuracy and convergence rate. Moreover, the results proved that the SAA obtained more competitive results than the previous methods to solve constrained engineering optimization problems, especially hybrid energy system design as well as economic load dispatch problems. © 2023 THE AUTHORS",

    "title": "Blue and green water accounting for climate change adaptation in a water scarce river basin",
    "abstract": "Understanding how climate change influences the portioning of rainfall into blue water (BW) and green water (GW) is vital for establishing adaptive water management strategies in water-scarce regions. This study presents a conceptual framework to investigate climate change impacts on blue and green water accounting by integrating a hydrological model with a multi-criteria decision-making approach to prioritize watersheds for climate change adaptation. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is adopted to investigate the hydrologic variability of BW and GW for baseline (1995–2019) and future (2020–2100) periods in a semi-arid Dharoi catchment of the Sabarmati River basin, India. The future climate data, derived from five general circulation models, are ensembled using a multi-model ensemble mean approach under two RCP (representative concentration pathways) scenarios. Several non-parametric tests are employed to ascertain statistically significant changes in the hydrologic variables between future and baseline periods. Further, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied considering seven attributes related to climate change, land use, and demographic parameters for watershed prioritization. Higher weights are assigned to the climate change attributes, followed by land use and demographic attributes. The SWAT results indicate a decrease in rainfall, BW, and GWS (green water storage) and an increase in temperature and GWF (green water flow) while traversing from the beginning of 2040 till the end of the 21st century under both RCPs. Thus, 2040 is established as a ‘tipping point’ for climate-induced changes in the Dharoi catchment, wherein a distinct reversal in the hydroclimatic regime is evident before and after 2040. Further, significant warming is observed by the end of 21st century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, contributing to a reduction in rainfall (up to 24.8%) and a decline in BW (up to 78.8%) across two-thirds of the watersheds in the Dharoi catchment. The AHP analysis identifies three out of ten watersheds as vulnerable and assigned ‘high priority’ for implementing adaptation measures to counter climate change-induced water scarcity. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "title": "Leveraging AI-enabled 6G-driven IoT for sustainable smart cities",
    "abstract": "Many scholastic researches have begun around the globe about the competitive technological interventions like 5G communication networks and its challenges. The incipient technology of 6G networks has emerged to facilitate ultrareliable and low-latency applications for sustainable smart cities which are infeasible with the existing 4G/5G standards. Therefore, the advanced technologies like machine learning (ML), block chain, and Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing 6G network are leveraged to develop cost-efficient mechanisms to address the issues of excess communication overhead in the present state of the art. Initially, the authors discussed the key vision of 6G communication technologies, its core technologies (such as visible light communication [VLC] and THz), and the existing issues with the existing network generations (such as 5G and 4G). A detailed analysis of benefits, challenges, and applications of blockchain-enabled IoT devices with application verticals like Smart city, smart factory plus, automation, and XR that form the key highlights for 6G wireless communication network is also presented. In addition, the key applications and latest research of artificial intelligence (AI) in 6G are discussed facilitating the dynamic spectrum allocation mechanism and mobile edge computing. Lastly, an in-depth study of the existing open issues and challenges in green 6G communication network technology, as well as review of solutions and potential research recommendations are also presented. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "title": "Metamaterial as perfect absorber for high sensitivity refractive index based biosensing applications at infrared frequencies",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel design of a metamaterial unit cell absorber, which is based on a metal/insulator/metal sandwich structure. The design is subjected to comprehensive finite element method computational analysis to ensure accurate and reliable results. The proposed metamaterial sandwich structure demonstrates exceptional absorption performance, achieving a nearly perfect absorption rate of 99.996% at the resonance infrared frequency of 39.8 THz. To provide a detailed theoretical explanation of nearly perfect absorption, we employ the effective medium theory, impedance matching, and field distribution analysis. Additionally, we have optimized the structural parameters of the sensor to maximize its absorption peak. This includes optimizing the thickness of the gold (Au) layer (from 0.03 to 0.28 μm), the distance between the L shape corners (from 0.60 to 0.90 μm), and the thickness of SiC dielectric spacer (from 0.20 to 0.45 μm). Furthermore, we showcase the remarkable sensitivity of the proposed metamaterial unit cell in detecting subtle changes in the refractive index through the implementation of a sensing medium setup in our model. Remarkably, we achieve a frequency shift sensitivity of 3.74 THz/RIU, along with a quality factor of 10.33, for a wide range of refractive indices (1.0-2.0). Moreover, for cancer detection, we attain a sensitivity of 3.5 THz/RIU. These findings highlight the exceptional performance of our approach in accurately detecting changes in refractive index, making it a promising candidate for various sensing applications. The novelty of our work lies in the design of a metamaterial unit cell structure. This configuration exhibits several noteworthy features, including wide incident angle ( θ ) coverage up to 60°, polarization insensitivity, exceptional frequency shift sensitivity, high absorption peaks across a wide range of refractive indices, and the ability to distinguish cancer cells from healthy ones. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

    "title": "Automated Deep Learning Artificial Intelligence Tool for Spleen Segmentation on CT: Defining Volume-Based Thresholds for Splenomegaly",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND. Splenomegaly historically has been assessed on imaging by use of potentially inaccurate linear measurements. Prior work tested a deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) tool that automatically segments the spleen to determine splenic volume. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to apply the deep learning AI tool in a large screening population to establish volume-based splenomegaly thresholds. METHODS. This retrospective study included a primary (screening) sample of 8901 patients (4235 men, 4666 women; mean age, 56 ±10 [SD] years) who underwent CT colonoscopy (n = 7736) or renal donor CT (n = 1165) from April 2004 to January 2017 and a secondary sample of 104 patients (62 men, 42 women; mean age, 56 ±8 years) with end-stage liver disease who underwent contrast-enhanced CT performed as part of evaluation for potential liver transplant from January 2011 to May 2013. The automated deep learning AI tool was used for spleen segmentation, to determine splenic volumes. Two radiologists independently reviewed a subset of segmentations. Weight-based volume thresholds for splenomegaly were derived using regression analysis. Performance of linear measurements was assessed. Frequency of splenomegaly in the secondary sample was determined using weight-based volumetric thresholds. RESULTS. In the primary sample, both observers confirmed splenectomy in 20 patients with an automated splenic volume of 0 mL; confirmed incomplete splenic coverage in 28 patients with a tool output error; and confirmed adequate segmentation in 21 patients with low volume (< 50 mL), 49 patients with high volume (> 600 mL), and 200 additional randomly selected patients. In 8853 patients included in analysis of splenic volumes (i.e., excluding a value of 0 mL or error values), the mean automated splenic volume was 216 ±100 [SD] mL. The weight-based volumetric threshold (expressed in milliliters) for splenomegaly was calculated as (3.01 × weight [expressed as kilograms]) + 127; for weight greater than 125 kg, the splenomegaly threshold was constant (503 mL). Sensitivity and specificity for volume-defined splenomegaly were 13% and 100%, respectively, at a true craniocaudal length of 13 cm, and 78% and 88% for a maximum 3D length of 13 cm. In the secondary sample, both observers identified segmentation failure in one patient. The mean automated splenic volume in the 103 remaining patients was 796 ±457 mL; 84% (87/103) of patients met the weight-based volume-defined splenomegaly threshold. CONCLUSION. We derived a weight-based volumetric threshold for splenomegaly using an automated AI-based tool. CLINICAL IMPACT. The AI tool could facilitate large-scale opportunistic screening for splenomegaly. © 2023 American Roentgen Ray Society. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Analyzing the microstructure of cemented fills adding polypropylene-glass fibers with X-ray micro-computed tomography",
    "abstract": "Fiber reinforced cementitious tailings backfill (FRCTB) is progressively employed in mining industry due to its high strength/stiffness-to-weight ratio. However, the wide use of the FRCTB technique requires further study of the practice of many different types of fibers, either alone or in combination. In this regard, this paper explores the impact of composite (glass-polypropylene) fibers on microstructure of FRCTBs considering weak surface and pore characteristics. The fractures of backfills were quantitatively analyzed by a non-destructive X-ray micro-computed tomography system which permits imagining of the interior microstructures of backfills via the construction of 3D volumetric data in diverse spatial scales. Quantitative parameters cover percent weak surface, porosity, and pore sphericity. The spatial distribution of weak surfaces, pores, and fissures and the bridging effect of fibers were also analyzed based on the 3D reconstruction technique. Adding fibers increased the percentage of FRCTB's weak surface. The greater the glass fiber dose, the larger the percentage of the weak surface. Composite fibers can lessen FRCTB's porosity. The smallest FRCTB porosity was 0.07 % for glass and PP fiber contents of 0.4 wt% and 0.2 wt%, respectively. A rise in glass fiber dose causes a rise in volume of 10–100 mm3 pore content. Fibers have a greater impact on the volume of 0.1–100 mm3 pores, and the rise in glass fiber dose deteriorates shape of this type of pores, leading to a reduction in the sphericity of this type of pores. There is a clear correlation between the distribution patterns of weak surfaces, pores, and fissures along the height of the specimens. Weak surfaces and pores are prone to develop as fractures. Fibers can limit the crack expansion in FRCTB. Lastly, this study presents a time- and cost-saving method for analyzing FRCTB's microstructure. © 2023 The Authors",

    "title": "Identifying weak signals to prepare for uncertainty in the energy sector",
    "abstract": "This study aims to prepare the energy sector for uncertainty using a foresight tool known as weak signals. Weak signals (subtle signs of emerging issues with significant impact potential) are often overlooked during strategic planning due to their inherent predictive uncertainty. However, the value does not lie in precise forecasting but in broadening the consideration of future possibilities. By proactively monitoring and addressing these otherwise neglected developments, stakeholders can gain early awareness of threats and opportunities and enhance their resilience, adaptability, and innovation. A panel of technology experts identified eight weak signals in this study: 1) growing mistrust and local grid security measures, 2) consumer reactions to overly prescriptive policies, 3) long-term forecasting errors for thin-margin projects, 4) emergence of variable power industries, and 5) establishment of intercontinental transmission precedence; including three potential ‘wild cards’ requiring proactive mitigation: 6) escalating electrical generation dependence on continued imports, 7) a new threat surpassing climate change, and 8) mass deployment of low-emissions technology triggering a runaway loss of social license. Political factors were the predominant source of uncertainty, as decisions can suddenly transform the energy landscape. Economic, technological, and social factors followed closely behind, generally through the emergence of new industries and behavioural responses. While environmental and legal factors were less frequent, stakeholders should still adopt a holistic approach, as the signals were found to be highly interconnected. Organisations should also assess their local context when applying these findings and continuously update and respond to their own list of weak signals. © 2023",

    "title": "STMMOT: Advancing multi-object tracking through spatiotemporal memory networks and multi-scale attention pyramids",
    "abstract": "Multi-object Tracking (MOT) is very important in human surveillance, sports analytics, autonomous driving, and cooperative robots. Current MOT methods do not perform well in non-uniform movements, occlusion and appearance–reappearance scenarios. We introduce a comprehensive MOT method that seamlessly merges object detection and identity linkage within an end-to-end trainable framework, designed with the capability to maintain object links over a long period of time. Our proposed model, named STMMOT, is architectured around 4 key modules: (1) Candidate proposal creation network, generates object proposals via vision-Transformer encoder–decoder architecture; (2) Scale variant pyramid, progressive pyramid structure to learn the self-scale and cross-scale similarities in multi-scale feature maps; (3) Spatio-temporal memory encoder, extracting the essential information from the memory associated with each object under tracking; and (4) Spatio-temporal memory decoder, simultaneously resolving the tasks of object detection and identity association for MOT. Our system leverages a robust spatio-temporal memory module that retains extensive historical object state observations and effectively encodes them using an attention-based aggregator. The uniqueness of STMMOT resides in representing objects as dynamic query embeddings that are updated continuously, which enables the prediction of object states with an attention mechanism and eradicates the need for post-processing. Experimental results show that STMMOT archives scores of 79.8 and 78.4 for IDF1, 79.3 and 74.1 for MOTA, 73.2 and 69.0 for HOTA, 61.2 and 61.5 for AssA, and maintained an ID switch count of 1529 and 1264 on MOT17 and MOT20, respectively. When evaluated on MOT20, it scored 78.4 in IDF1, 74.1 in MOTA, 69.0 in HOTA, and 61.5 in AssA, and kept the ID switch count to 1264. Compared with the previous best TransMOT, STMMOT achieves around a 4.58% and 4.25% increase in IDF1, and ID switching reduction to 5.79% and 21.05% on MOT17 and MOT20, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "title": "DeepGR4J: A deep learning hybridization approach for conceptual rainfall-runoff modelling",
    "abstract": "Despite the considerable success of deep learning methods in modelling physical processes, they suffer from a variety of issues such as overfitting and lack of interpretability. In hydrology, conceptual rainfall-runoff models are simple yet fast and effective tools to represent the underlying physical processes through lumped storage components. Although conceptual rainfall-runoff models play a vital role in supporting decision-making in water resources management and urban planning, they have limited flexibility to take data into account for the development of robust region-wide models. The combination of deep learning and conceptual models has the potential to address some of the aforementioned limitations. This paper presents a sub-model hybridization of the GR4J rainfall-runoff model with deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The results show that the hybrid models outperform both the base conceptual model as well as the canonical deep neural network architectures in terms of the Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) score across 223 catchments in Australia. We show that our hybrid model provides a significant improvement in predictive performance, particularly in arid catchments, and generalizing better across catchments. © 2023 The Author(s)",

    "title": "A hardware-independent time estimation method for inference process of convolutional layers on GPU",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, various AI applications based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely deployed on GPU-accelerated devices. However, due to the lack of visibility into GPU internal scheduling, accurately modeling the performance of CNN inference tasks or estimating the latency of CNN tasks that are executing or waiting on the GPU is challenging. This hurts the multi-model scheduling on multi-device and CNN real-time inference. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a time estimation method to estimate the forward execution time of a convolutional layer with an arbitrary shape on a GPU. The proposed method divides an explicit General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) convolution operation into a series of estimatable GPU operations and constructs performance models at the level of sub-operations rather than hardware instructions or entire models. Also, the proposed method can be easily adapted to different hardware devices or underlying algorithm implementations, since it focuses on the variation of execution time relative to the input data scale, without focusing on specific instructions or hardware actions. According to the experiments on four typical CUDA compatible platforms, the proposed method has an average error rate of less than 5% for convolutional layers in some practical CNN models, and has about 8% error rate in estimating GEMM convolution implementations provided by cuDNN library. Experiments show that the proposed method can predict the forward execution time of convolutional layers of arbitrary size in CNN inference tasks on different GPU models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

    "title": "Recent advances in magnetically responsive photonic crystals assembled by anisotropic building blocks: Synthesis, challenges and outstanding applications",
    "abstract": "Photonic crystals (PC) are periodically ordered dielectric materials with a wide range of tunable optical properties and are the basis for most studies of responsive optical systems. However, current challenges in photonic crystal performance include limited tunability of the band gap, slow response to external stimuli, irreversibility, and difficulty in integration into existing optical systems. Magnetically responsive photonic crystals (MRPC) can effectively improve these problems and simplify the structure of responsive photonic crystals. Therefore, MRPC has become a research hotspot, but most of the current research focuses on isotropic (spherical) particles. So far, no one has systematically summarized the magnetic photonic crystals prepared by nanoparticles with different shapes and compared them with spherical photonic crystals. This paper first introduces non-spherical nanoparticles as the basic unit for constructing magnetic photonic crystals. These anisotropic building blocks will inject new blood into the magnetic photonic crystal. In addition, we also describe the preparation and applications of magnetically responsive photonic crystals and categorically explore the characteristics of magnetically responsive photonic crystals assembled by anisotropic building blocks. Finally, we summarize the challenges in the field of MRPC and provide an outlook for their further development in the next stage. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

    "title": "Sequential Modeling and Knowledge Source Integration for Identifying the Structure of a Bayesian Network for Multistage Process Monitoring and Diagnosis",
    "abstract": "As a popular applied artificial intelligence tool, Bayesian networks are increasingly being used to model multistage manufacturing processes for fault diagnosis purposes. However, the major issue limiting the practical adoption of Bayesian networks is the difficulty of learning the network structure for large multistage processes. Traditionally, Bayesian network structures are learned either with the help of domain experts or by utilizing data-driven structure learning algorithms through trial and error. Both approaches have their limitations. On the one hand, the expert-driven approach is costly, time-consuming, cumbersome for large networks, and susceptible to errors in assessing probabilities; on the other hand, data-driven approaches suffer from noise, biases, and inadequacy of training data and often fail to capture the physical causal structure of the data. Therefore, in this article, we propose a Bayesian network structure learning approach where popular manufacturing knowledge sources like the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) and hierarchical variable ordering are used as structural priors to guide the data-driven structure learning process. In addition, to introduce modularity and flexibility into the learning process, we present a sequential modeling approach for structure learning so that large multistage networks can be learned stage by stage progressively. Furthermore, through simulation studies, we compare and analyze the performance of the knowledge source-based structurally biased networks in the context of multistage process fault diagnosis. © 2024 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

    "abstract": "The current research examined the effectiveness of two social influence strategies—reciprocity and social validation—in promoting sustainable consumer behavior. In an initial behavioral field experiment (Study 1), consumers were either exposed to a reciprocity, social validation, or control message distributed in the changing rooms of a sporting goods store. The daily number of cleanups carried out by store employees were then monitored as a function of message type. Results revealed that messages based on reciprocity and social validation led to a significant reduction in the number of cleanups compared to the control message, with no significant difference between the reciprocity and social validation conditions. In a follow-up online experiment with increased rigor and control (Study 2), participants were randomly assigned to a reciprocity, social validation, or control condition and subsequently indicated their willingness to shop sustainably. Consistent with the findings from Study 1, both the reciprocity and social validation conditions outperformed the control condition regarding participants’ willingness to engage in sustainable consumer behavior, with no significant difference between the reciprocity and social validation conditions. Together, this research suggests that the strategic use of reciprocity or social validation messages can help store managers reduce the environmental impact of consumers’ shopping responses, while simultaneously decreasing operating costs. © 2023 The Authors",

    "title": "Dual attention transformer network for hyperspectral image classification",
    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) has been a significant topic in the field of remote sensing in the past few years. Convolutional neural networks have shown promising performance in HSIC applications due to their strong local feature extraction ability. However, they struggle to extract global information from HSIs, thereby resulting in classification performance limitations. Recently, vision transformers have been used to solve HSIC problems, and its advantage is to adopt the multi-head self-attention mechanism to explore global dependencies. Nevertheless, the extracted features using MHSA usually exhibit over-dispersion due to the abundance of band information hidden in HSIs. In this work, we propose a novel method, called dual attention transformer network (DATN), for HSIC problems. It consists of two types of modules, namely the spatial–spectral hybrid transformer (SSHT) module and the spectral local-conv block (SLCB) module. Specifically, the SSHT module aims to utilize the MHSA to capture spatial and spectral feature information. Therefore, it can effectively utilize global spatial–spectral features and embed the local spatial information, simultaneously. Besides, we design a SLCB module to extract the local spectral information of HSIs effectively. Then the SSHT and SLCB modules are integrated into an end-to-end framework. Finally, the global and local spatial–spectral features extracted from this framework are input into the fully connected layer, and then classification results of HSIs are obtained. A series of experiments on three HSI datasets have demonstrated that our DATN approach outperforms several state-of-the-art HSIC approaches. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "abstract": "The paper presents the results of a study of human perception of emotional stimuli within the valence-arousal theory of emotion. The study involved 2 stages—EEG recording during viewing of images of 4 valences: happy, sad, excited, and angry. After each image, the participant identified the emotion first and then responded to a Likert scale on the intensity of the emotionality of the picture, defined as cognitive processing. The main result revealed a tendency toward significant difference in the assessment of the emotion intensity by the male and the female participants for 3 of the valences—happy, excited, and angry, but not for the sad.

    "abstract": "At present, there are many children accompanying robots. A key indicator to measure their performance is convenient and efficient human–computer interaction. The implementation of voice question-answering technology needs to solve three problems: voice recognition, the establishment of a knowledge base, and answer matching. As the front-end data entry, speech recognition accuracy is directly related to the answer-matching effect of the back-end question-answering system. Based on convolutional neural network and intelligent communication technology, this paper analyzes the characteristics of children's reading robot and designs and develops intelligent voice interaction function on the Android platform. The focus of this paper is on Chinese word segmentation and keyword extraction and matching in the interaction function. Further, we designed a simple question-and-answer database for the children's reading robot. In this paper, convolutional neural network connection timing is used as the feature parameter. Through a large number of experiments, the structure of the CNN network is constantly adjusted to minimize the word error rate, optimize the model recognition rate, and better identify users' voice problems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to destroy the carbon market. To alleviate the situation, governments launched vaccination program campaigns. This study aims to predict two carbon pricing features––return and volatility––considering the impacts of the COVID-19 vaccination program. The present study applies the SHAPley Additive exPlanations method of model analysis and interpretability to determine the forces that predict carbon pricing. Our results show that compared with the volatility of the carbon market, the number of daily vaccinations has better predictive performance in terms of carbon pricing. However, compared with other related control factors, the predictive contribution of the COVID-19 vaccination program to volatility is greater than the return of the carbon market. In addition, a smaller number of daily vaccinations correspond to higher carbon market volatility and lower returns. Our results have crucial implications for investors and policymakers in stabilizing and promoting the carbon market during the COVID-19 pandemic; moreover, our results provide a reference for formulating new COVID-19 vaccination-related policies. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

    "title": "Wavelet U-Net++ for accurate lung nodule segmentation in CT scans: Improving early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer",
    "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, and accurate segmentation of lung nodules is critical for its early detection and diagnosis. However, small nodules often have low contrast and are challenging to distinguish from noise and other structures in medical images, making accurate segmentation difficult. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Wavelet U-Net++ for accurately segmenting lung nodules. Our approach combines the U-Net++ architecture with wavelet pooling to capture both high- and low-frequency information in the image, enabling improved segmentation accuracy. Specifically, we use the Haar wavelet transform to downsample the feature maps in the encoder, allowing for fine-grained details in the image to be captured. We evaluated our proposed approach on the LIDC-IDRI dataset, which consists of 1018 CT scans with annotated lung nodules. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art segmentation methods, achieving a mean dice coefficient of 0.936 and a mean IoU of 0.878. Moreover, we show that wavelet pooling combined with Tversky and CE loss improves the network's ability to detect small and irregular nodules that are conventionally difficult to segment, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining loss functions. Overall, our proposed approach demonstrates the effectiveness of combining wavelet pooling with the U-Net++ architecture for accurate segmentation of lung nodules. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "abstract": "Manufacturing industry is experiencing another revolution towards the digitalization of industrial processes. Different value chain actors must share specific and sensitive data according to business and data requirements. Digital architectures must ensure seamless and comprehensive communications between actors according to agreed-upon vocabularies. The digital representation of machines and other types of equipment, including crucial information about their static and dynamic operational data, is made possible by the ontological modelling of Asset Administration Shells (AAS), which is proposed in this paper as modular and semantically interoperable resources. These Cognitive Digital Twins are herein defined with de facto domain ontologies that model the semantics of the current operation, status and configurations of assets.

    "title": "Smell and Taste Disorders Knowledge Graph: Answering Questions Using Health Data",
    "abstract": "Smell and taste disorders have become a more prominent issue due to their association with Covid-19, and their impact on quality of life and health outcomes. However, pertinent information regarding these disorders is often inaccessible and poorly organized, with the majority of data stored solely in clinical data repositories. To rectify this, a technological solution capable of digitizing, semantically modeling, and integrating health data is necessary. The knowledge graph, an emerging technology capable of organizing inconsistent and heterogeneous health data and inferring implicit knowledge, presents a viable solution to this problem. In pursuit of the aforementioned goal, an existing ontology pertaining to smell and taste disorders was enriched by introducing additional relevant concepts and relationships. Subsequently, a knowledge graph was constructed based on the defined ontology and patients’ data. The resultant knowledge graph was subjected to a rigorous evaluation, encompassing dimensions such as completeness, coherency, coverage, and succinctness. The evaluation established the effectiveness and usability of the knowledge graph, with only minor issues detected through the OOPS! pitfall scanner. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept for clinical application, a user interface was created, enabling users to access pertinent information concerning smell and taste disorders, including causative factors, medications, and etiology, among others. The interface generates a graph-based structure based on the selected question from a drop-down menu. The end-user can modify the query by merely clicking on the generated graph to ask related questions. This study showcases the potential of knowledge graphs centered on smell and taste disorders to organize and provide accessible health data to end-users. © 2023 The Author(s)",

    "title": "Integrated vegetation cover of typical steppe in China based on mixed decomposing derived from high resolution remote sensing data",
    "abstract": "Grasslands represent the largest ecosystem in China, accurate and efficient extraction of its integrated vegetation cover (IVC) plays a crucial role in supporting policy decisions. This study presented a method for grassland monitoring via IVC derived from high-resolution satellite data. Taking the multispectral data of Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Gaofen-6 (GF-6) with 16 m resolution as the main data source, vegetation cover of six representative regions was assessed based on mixed-pixel decomposition model. Using grassland vegetation cover and ratio of grassland area, the IVC in each site was calculated and verified against ground-measured sample data. The results showed that the IVC of grassland was closely related to vegetation habitat driven by regional hydrothermal regime. Yichang grassland, dominated with warm-temperate shrub tussock type, had the highest IVC (80.06 %) due to its favorable hydrothermal conditions. For the main grassland types in Hulunbuir and Gansu Province (temperate meadow steppe and temperate typical steppe), the IVC was 79.38 % and 58.46 %, respectively. In both Xilin-Gol and Nagqu, vegetation cover decreased gradually from east to west, and the IVC was merely 42.83 % and 42.61 %, respectively. Both regions are endowed with less hydrothermal resources to different degrees. Alxa, with a predominately temperate desert landscape, had the lowest IVC of 15.58 % where precipitation is extremely scarce. Based on the grass species of measured samples, the dominant species and biodiversity of different grassland types in Gansu Province and Hulunbuir Municipality of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were analyzed. The results showed that the meadow grassland has the richest biodiversity. The temperate mountain meadows in Gansu Province have a high species diversity, with a total of 90 grass species, and the lowland meadows in Hulunbuir have a total of 49 grass species. This study utilizes high-resolution data to conduct large-scale vegetation monitoring, which is a viable alternative for efficient assessment of steppe ecology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

    "title": "A Multi-joint Optimisation Method for Distributed Edge Computing Resources in IoT-Based Smart Cities",
    "abstract": "Smart cities can handle numerous IoT devices with enhanced services that offer intelligent and effective answers to different elements of urban life. Smart cities use the Internet of Things (IoT). Even as the amount of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart city services, and quality of service (QoS) limits increase quickly, servers must allocate finite resources among all Internet-based services to deliver efficient implementation. A smart city's IoT system uses a lot of energy and experiences network latency since a cloud exists. Depending on a cloud computing architecture, edge computing relocates processing, memory, and a shared network near the data provider. The cloud computing model is the same as the IoT model. Optimal energy use while upholding time constraints is a crucial issue in edge computing when carrying out activities produced by IoT devices. This research examines a multi-joint optimization method for distributing edge computing resources in IoT-based smart cities. For IoT-based smart cities, we suggest a Four-layer network design. After that, other air offloading algorithms are added depending on the weight and capacity of the UAV's motor, its altitude just above the surface, and the area it may create. A proposed edge resource allocation strategy based on an actionable method is put forth to provide efficient computing resources for delay-sensitive jobs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

    "title": "Data-driven process adjustment policies for quality improvement",
    "abstract": "Common objectives in machine learning research are to predict the output quality of manufacturing processes, to perform root cause analysis in case of reduced quality, and to propose intervention strategies. The cost of reduced quality must be weighed against the cost of the interventions, which depend on required downtime, personnel costs, and material costs. Furthermore, there is a risk of false negatives, i.e., failure to identify the true root causes, or false positives, i.e., adjustments that further reduce the quality. A policy for process adjustments describes when and where to perform interventions, and we say that a policy is worthwhile if it reduces the expected operational cost. In this paper, we describe a data-driven alarm and root cause analysis framework, that given a predictive and explanatory model trained on high-dimensional process and quality data, can be used to search for a worthwhile adjustment policy. The framework was evaluated on large-scale simulated process and quality data. We find that worthwhile adjustment policies can be derived also for problems with a large number of explanatory variables. Interestingly, the performance of the adjustment policies is almost exclusively driven by the quality of the model fits. Based on these results, we discuss key areas of future research, and how worthwhile adjustment policies can be implemented in real world applications. © 2023 The Author(s)",

    "title": "Bias learning improves data driven models for streamflow prediction",
    "abstract": "Study region: Andun river basin of Southern China and 273 watersheds across the continental United States. Study focus: Owing to the data incompleteness and the changing environment, there is bias existing in the data driven models for streamflow prediction, greatly limiting their application in actual practice. In this paper, we incorporate the bias learning components into the data driven models to establish the mapping-bias-learning models, and design two groups of experiments, one in the Andun River basin in China and the other in 273 watersheds in the continental United States (CONUS). In the first group of experiments, we respectively apply three machine learning algorithms and one traditional statistical method to generate sixteen mapping-bias-learning models ae well as four mapping-learning-alone models. We also explore the effectiveness of different bias learning strategies, including multiple bias learning, stacking bias learning and incremental updating bias learning. In the second group of experiments, we apply the mapping-bias-learning models to the streamflow prediction in 273 watersheds of CONUS to verify the universality and robustness of the bias learning method. New hydrological insights for the region: The mapping-bias-learning models significantly outperform the mapping-learning-alone models, and the machine learning methods are superior to the traditional statistical method in term of the ability of bias learning. In addition, adopting the appropriate bias learning strategies can further improve the streamflow forecast performance of data-driven models. The bias learning method is applicable to various watersheds with different hydrological conditions and play efficient roles at different streamflow levels. The median of MRE drops from 0.156 for mapping-learning-alone models to 0.131 for mapping-bias-learning models, while median of NSE increases from 0.918 for mapping-learning-alone models to 0.932 for mapping-bias-learning models. More inspiringly, the bias learning method can still play roles in data driven models under the environmental conditions that never occurred before, suggesting its remarkable superiority. This study highlights the power of the bias learning method for data driven models in streamflow prediction, and the promising prospect of the combination between bias learning and machine learning methods in hydrological modelling. © 2023",

Detection sites must be magnetically shimmed to ppb uniformity, which for parallel detection is precluded by commercial shimming technology. Here we show that, by centering a separate shim system over each detector and employing deep learning to cope with overlapping non-orthogonal shimming fields, parallel detectors can be rapidly calibrated. Our implementation also reports the smallest NMR stripline detectors to date, based on an origami technique, facilitating further upscaling in the number of detection sites within the magnet bore. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",

    "abstract": "Congenital malformations of the central nervous system are among the most common major congenital malformations. Deep learning systems have come to the fore in prenatal diagnosis of congenital malformation, but the impact of deep learning-assisted detection of congenital intracranial malformations from fetal neurosonographic images has not been evaluated. Here we report a three-way crossover, randomized control trial (Trial Registration: ChiCTR2100048233) that assesses the efficacy of a deep learning system, the Prenatal Ultrasound Diagnosis Artificial Intelligence Conduct System (PAICS), in assisting fetal intracranial malformation detection. A total of 709 fetal neurosonographic images/videos are read interactively by 36 sonologists of different expertise levels in three reading modes: unassisted mode (without PAICS assistance), concurrent mode (using PAICS at the beginning of the assessment) and second mode (using PAICS after a fully unaided interpretation). Aided by PAICS, the average accuracy of the unassisted mode (73%) is increased by the concurrent mode (80%; P < 0.001) and the second mode (82%; P < 0.001). Correspondingly, the AUC is increased from 0.85 to 0.89 and to 0.90, respectively (P < 0.001 for all). The median read time per data is slightly increased in concurrent mode but substantially prolonged in the second mode, from 6 s to 7 s and to 11 s (P < 0.001 for all). In conclusion, PAICS in both concurrent and second modes has the potential to improve sonologists’ performance in detecting fetal intracranial malformations from neurosonographic data. PAICS is more efficient when used concurrently for all readers. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",

A model predictive control (MPC)-based load frequency control strategy for the IPS with photovoltaic aggregation and energy storage systems under model uncertainty and communication delay is proposed. This can effectively overcome the issues of model uncertainty, random load perturbation and communication delay. First, a state space model for the IPS is constructed. To coordinate the frequency and contact line power fluctuation of the IPS, a robust controller based on the theory of MPC is then designed. Then, considering the communication delay of frequency response commands during transmission, a predictive compensation mechanism is introduced to eliminate the effect of delay while considering model uncertainty. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy. © 2023, Power System Protection and Control Press.",

    "title": "Industry 4.0 as a strategy to contribute to the water supply universalization in developing countries",
    "abstract": "Access to safe water is still a challenge. Millions of people worldwide, mainly in rural and remote regions, still do not have access to safe drinking water. Point-of-use and decentralized water treatment systems have the potential to improve their livelihood, especially if these technologies are combined with the advantages brought by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This paper presents and discusses opportunities for convergence between water treatment mainly using membrane separation processes and technologies related to Industry 4.0, focusing on a scenario of decentralized systems installed in developing countries. Emphasis is given to membrane-based applications due to their advantages of ease of operation, small area requirements, and reduced implementation time while maintaining a great capacity to produce high water quality regardless of raw water characteristics. Literature suggests that Industry 4.0 can be considered an ally to better support water management in remote and rural regions. Treatment units can now be integrated into digital cyber-physical systems to promote a greater comprehension of local necessities and provide transparent and effective communication, faster actions, or even remote and automatic operation, contributing to the capacitation of local operators and the performance and conservation of the infrastructure. It is also possible to monitor many parameters of water quality, ensuring process integrity and safe water. These advancements may result in affordable, adaptive, and resilient solutions, but it is necessary to consider the perspective of the Human Right to Water and Sanitation – unfortunately, not always present – and the difficulties inherent to developing countries. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "abstract": "Virtual machine introspection (VMI) is the process of extracting knowledge about the inner state of a virtual machine from the outside. Traditional passive introspection mechanisms have proved themselves ineffective in many application domains due to their low performance. As a remedy for this issue, caching at the level of the introspection application was introduced. However, this sacrificed the freshness of VMI and led to an inconsistent outside view. In this work, we propose a multi-purpose hybrid caching scheme with freshness and consistency guarantees that is interleaved with the guest's MMU. This scheme can easily be integrated into existing applications and frameworks such as libvmi and Volatility 3. We demonstrate its feasibility by developing a prototype for such applications. Furthermore, the experimental evaluation of our approach suggests that it even significantly exceeds the performance of previous inconsistent caches. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "abstract": "Gait recognition has become a developing technology in various security, industrial, medical, and military applications. This paper proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to authenticate humans via their walking style. The proposed model has been applied to two commonly used standardized datasets, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and Osaka University-Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research (OU-ISIR). After the silhouette images have been isolated from the gait image datasets, their features have been extracted using the proposed deep CNN and the traditional ones, including AlexNet, Inception (GoogleNet), VGGNet, ResNet50, and Xception. The best features were selected using genetic, grey wolf optimizer (GWO), particle swarm optimizer (PSO), and chi-square algorithms. Finally, recognize the selected features using the proposed deep neural network (DNN). Several performance evaluation parameters have been estimated to evaluate the model’s quality, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, false negative rate (FNR), and training time. Experiments have demonstrated that the suggested framework with a genetic feature selector outperforms previous selectors and recent research, scoring accuracy values of 99.46% and 99.09% for evaluating the CASIA and OU-ISIR datasets, respectively, in low time (19 seconds for training). © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

    "title": "Use of machine learning and deep learning to predict particulate 137Cs concentrations in a nuclearized river",
    "abstract": "Cesium-137, discharged by nuclear installations under normal operations and deposited in watersheds following atmospheric testing and accidents (i.e. Chernobyl, Fukushima …), has been studied for decades. Thus, modelling of 137Cs concentration in rivers have been developed based on geochemical approaches and equilibrium assumptions (solid/liquid ratio) as this radionuclide has moved into rivers and oceans due to soil erosion. Recently a new approach is possible to model these concentrations with the popularization of data-driven models based on data acquired in the environment by monitoring networks. In this study, the concentrations of particulate cesium-137 measured near the mouth of the Rhône River (France), a highly nuclearized river, are simulated using two data-driven models, a Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks (HRHN) and a Random Forest Regressor (RF). The data-driven predictions were done using only hydrological data (water discharge and suspended solid fluxes) and industrial input of 137Cs. Although the data-driven models provided a better prediction than a recent empirical model, the best prediction (R2 = 0.71) was obtained with HRHN, a model that considers the temporal aspect of the monitoring data. The most important predictors were the hydrological data at the monitoring station and of the tributary that generate the most sediment flux (Durance River). In fact, the concentration of 137Cs in the perimeter of this study was more related to hydrology than to nuclear release, as there were few events with high 137Cs concentrations (concomitant nuclear release and low water discharge). However, the HRHN approach, which is more complex to implement than RF, can predict the concentrations of such events correctly despite their low representation of these events. The results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of data-driven models to assist monitoring programs by filling in gaps or helping to understand observed concentrations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "title": "Catalog and detection techniques of microservice anti-patterns and bad smells: A tertiary study",
    "abstract": "Background: Various works investigated microservice anti-patterns and bad smells in the past few years. We identified seven secondary publications that summarize these, but they have little overlap in purpose and often use different terms to describe the identified anti-patterns and smells. Objective: This work catalogs recurring bad design practices known as anti-patterns and bad smells for microservice architectures, and provides a classification into categories as well as methods for detecting these practices. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review in the form of a tertiary study targeting secondary studies identifying poor design practices for microservices. Results: We provide a comprehensive catalog of 58 disjoint anti-patterns, grouped into five categories, which we derived from 203 originally identified anti-patterns for microservices. Conclusion: The results provide a reference to microservice developers to design better-quality systems and researchers who aim to detect system quality based on anti-patterns. It also serves as an anti-pattern catalog for development-aiding tools, which are not currently available for microservice system development but could mitigate quality degradation throughout system evolution. © 2023 The Author(s)",

    "title": "Tracking phishing on Ethereum: Transaction network embedding approach for accounts representation learning",
    "abstract": "The transaction volume of Ethereum has been witnessing a year-on-year increase, which has unfortunately been accompanied by significant losses due to phishing scams. To enhance the ability of downstream classifiers to distinguish phishing accounts more effectively, we produce dense representations of Ethereum accounts in latent space, leveraging the transaction network topology and associated statistical features. However, the task of learning representations from sparse yet voluminous transaction records presents a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Temporal-based Sequences Generator (TSG) and the Heterogeneous-based Sequences Generator (HSG). These generators create sequences from the transaction network, optimizing the use of transaction temporal constraints, diverse account types, and transaction amounts. Our method aims to capture latent higher-order information and generate dense vectors using a network embedding technique. Furthermore, we propose a novel Statistics-Based Sampling (SBS) method to mitigate label leakage. We validate our approach through experiments with various classic downstream classifiers, demonstrating that Phish2vec surpasses other comparative methods in performance and exhibits robustness and stability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "title": "Machine-Learning Model for Predicting Maintenance Costs of EPDM Roofing Systems",
    "abstract": "Facility managers often need to accurately predict the annual maintenance of their building roofs to develop reliable and cost-effective maintenance plans that maximize their performance and life expectancy. This article presents the development of a novel machine learning (ML) model using XGBoost to predict maintenance costs of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) roofing systems, and compare its performance to multivariate linear regression (MLR). The two models were developed in three main phases that focused on data collection and processing, model development, and performance evaluation. The collected data include 374 historical annual maintenance records of EPDM roofs that consist of maintenance cost, age, area, opening rate, and weather data. The performance of the two developed models was evaluated using four metrics: mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), accuracy, root square mean error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The outcome of this performance evaluation illustrates that the average accuracy of the ML model in predicting maintenance costs of EPDM roofs (88.20%) was significantly higher than the MLR model (68.30%). This highlights the original contributions of the developed ML model. The ML model has novel capabilities to provide much-needed support for facility managers to improve the accuracy of estimating the annual maintenance costs of EPDM roofs to ensure the development of reliable maintenance plans for this type of roof. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

    "title": "A multi-sensor fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery based on improved fuzzy support fusion and self-normalized spatio-temporal network",
    "abstract": "Recently, the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery based on deep learning has achieved increasingly widespread applications. However, it is often difficult to achieve the expected results by relying on a single sensor due to the limited information obtained by the single sensor and the susceptibility to the influence of the additive noise. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a multi-sensor fusion fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery based on improved fuzzy support fusion and self-normalized spatio-temporal network to enhance feature learning while achieving multi-sensor data fusion. This method includes a data pre-processing module, a fusion module and a fault recognition module. In the first module, a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise algorithm is introduced to decompose and reconstruct the multi-source sensor signals, thereby reducing the impact of environmental noise on data quality. In the fusion module, a data fusion algorithm based on improved fuzzy support is designed to achieve the data-level fusion of multi-source sensors. By introducing the self-normalized properties into the convolutional structure with bi-directional gated recurrent unit, a self-normalized spatio-temporal network is designed in the fault recognition module to perform the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve high quality data-level fusion and outperforms the state-of-the-art fault diagnosis methods in terms of fault classification. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine has revolutionised cancer treatments; however, actionable biomarkers remain scarce. To address this, we develop the Oncology Biomarker Discovery (OncoBird) framework for analysing the molecular and biomarker landscape of randomised controlled clinical trials. OncoBird identifies biomarkers based on single genes or mutually exclusive genetic alterations in isolation or in the context of tumour subtypes, and finally, assesses predictive components by their treatment interactions. Here, we utilise the open-label, randomised phase III trial (FIRE-3, AIO KRK-0306) in metastatic colorectal carcinoma patients, who received either cetuximab or bevacizumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and irinotecan (FOLFIRI). We systematically identify five biomarkers with predictive components, e.g., patients with tumours that carry chr20q amplifications or lack mutually exclusive ERK signalling mutations benefited from cetuximab compared to bevacizumab. In summary, OncoBird characterises the molecular landscape and outlines actionable biomarkers, which generalises to any molecularly characterised randomised controlled trial. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",

    "title": "Artificial neural networks for insights into adsorption capacity of industrial dyes using carbon-based materials",
    "abstract": "Organic waste-derived carbon-based materials (CBMs) are commonly applied in sustainable wastewater treatment and waste management. CBMs can remove toxic, non-biodegradable and carcinogenic pollutants such as dyes which include indigo, triphenylmethyl, azo, anthraquinone and phthalocyanine derivatives. Nonetheless, their diverse composition, surface properties, presence of numerous surface functional groups and the altering adsorption experimental conditions to which they are applied against the elimination of organic dyes make it challenging to completely understand the removal mechanism. Herein, a dataset of 1514 data points was compiled from various published peer-reviewed journals along with additional adsorption experiments conducted in this study. Artificial neural networks (ANN) based machine learning (ML) model was compared with other ML and a deep learning model named Tab-Transformer and the findings proposed ANN showed superior prediction performance for adsorption capacity as a function of adsorbent synthesis conditions, adsorbent physical characteristics and adsorption experimental conditions. The hyperparameters of ANN model was optimized using Bayesian optimizer and the batch size, activation and units were proven to be more important than the number of hidden layers and learning rate. The ANN model exhibits a higher coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.98) and lower root mean square error (RMSE = 46.95 mg/g) values for test dataset. Feature importance using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis suggested that the adsorption characteristics with 51.4% was the most important in the ANN prediction followed by the adsorption experimental condition (31.2%) and adsorbent synthesis condition (17.4%). Moreover, the impact of six most important features were individually analyzed. Finally, a detailed discussion on the environmental impact of the presented ANN model is also included. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

    "title": "An empirical study of learning-to-rank for spare parts consumption in the repair process",
    "abstract": "The repair process of devices is an important part of the business of many original equipment manufacturers. The consumption of spare parts, during the repair process, is driven by the defects found during inspection of the devices, and these parts are a big part of the costs in the repair process. In previous work, we proposed a data-driven method for Supply Chain Control Tower solutions to provide support for the automatic check of spare parts consumption in the repair process. In this article, we continue our investigation of a multi-label classification problem and explore alternatives in the learning-to-rank approach, where we simulate the passage of time using more data while training and comparing hundreds of Machine Learning models to provide an automatic check in the consumption of spare parts. We investigate the effects of different train set sizes, retraining intervals, models and hyper-parameter search using Bayesian Optimization. We define a custom metric, the Ratio of Marked Parts, measuring how many spare parts are marked for revision at the end of the repair process. The results show that we were able to improve the trained models and achieve a higher mean NDCG@20 score of 86% when ranking the expected parts. While focusing on the most recent data, we achieved a NDCG@20 score of 90% and obtained a Ratio of Marked Parts of just 4% of the consumed parts for use in alert generation. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Political parties often engage in verbal swordplay, which worsens during elections. Free and fair elections are the pillar of a democratic society. Come election season, all media outlets, including the Internet, are buzzing with politically-charged content. We curated 46 k posts from Twitter between January and March, 2022 to examine political content during the Indian assembly elections of February 2022. We begin our analysis by manually labeling 1.7 k posts for different forms of attack and employ the annotation to examine political attacks against defamatory hashtags and name-calling. It anecdotally lends itself to the target’s online reputation. Similarly, we quantify the power dynamics of self-promotion and negation pinned on the ruling party before and after elections. To aid large-scale analysis, we obtain pseudo-labels for the rest of the dataset via training a political attack detector for the Indic setting. Subsequently, we observe that the patterns detected via manual annotations hold at scale too. Our analyses and findings aim to educate the citizenry about the quality of political discourse on Indian Twitter. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",

    "title": "Rough Fermatean fuzzy decision-based approach for modelling IDS classifiers in the federated learning of IoMT applications",
    "abstract": "Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are commonly employed to mitigate network security threats in various fields, including federated learning applications within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). However, IDSs face challenges owing to the sheer volume of network traffic, high-dimensional datasets and the necessity for real-time detection. Although machine learning integration assists IDSs in overcoming these challenges, modelling difficulties persist due to varied evaluation criteria and levels of conflict and importance. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) solutions have been utilised in IoMT and IDS, yet they fall short in capturing the subjective judgements of experts and rely on normalisation approaches, which can impact results. This study seeks to address these issues through the integration of robust MCDM methodologies, namely fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) and fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM). Utilising rough Fermatean fuzzy sets (RFFSs), this integration produces precise solutions with reduced uncertainty. Our methodology involves adopting a decision matrix for IDS classifiers based on integrated evaluation criteria, followed by deriving new formulations and developments for RFFSs-based FDOSM and FWZIC for the modelling and weighting of criteria, respectively. Evaluations using datasets involving 125,973 records and 41 features across 17 evaluation criteria revealed that accuracy–security and training time–performance weights yielded the highest scores, whereas false negative rate–security and CPU time–performance criteria received the lowest weights. The random forest emerged as the optimal IDS classifier. Systematic modelling, sensitivity analysis and comparative studies confirmed the robustness of our results. © 2023, Crown.",

The paper shows several applications for statistical methods, machine learning, and hybrid methods that leverage the advantages of both statistical and deep learning techniques. Furthermore, ensembles are exposed as an efficient technique used with the mentioned models for anomaly detection in online time series. The paper discusses the challenges associated with temporal correlation, including the need for effective visualisation tools such as DeepVats.

    "title": "A Novel Framework for Credit Card Fraud Detection",
    "abstract": "Credit card transactions have grown considerably in the last few years. However, this increase has led to significant financial losses around the world. More than that, processing the enormous amount of generated data becomes very challenging, making the datasets highly dimensional and unbalanced. This means the collected data is suffering from two major problems. It is characterized by a severe difference in observation frequency between fraud and non-fraud transactions, and it contains irrelevant, inappropriate, and correlated data that negatively affects their prediction performance. Consequently, it has attracted the interest of machine learning (ML), which has become a significant actor in fraud detection. ML has provided methods such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support vector machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). However, these methods cannot meet the outstanding performance required to detect and predict unusual fraud patterns. In this regard, the contribution of this paper is to propose a framework for fraud detection (FFD). At first, to overcome the unbalanced data problem, the framework uses an undersampling technique. Next, a feature selection (FS) mechanism is applied to select only relevant features. Then, a Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) is used to build the ML model. SVDD aims to create a tight boundary around regular data points to distinguish them from potential outliers or anomalies. In order to enhance optimization capability for its hyperparameters C and σ , a modified version of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, Polynomial Self Learning PSO (PSLPSO), is proposed. As a result, the framework's effectiveness is shown in the experimental results on a real credit card transaction dataset. © 2013 IEEE.",

    "title": "Overconfidence Bias in Investment Decisions: A Systematic Mapping of Literature and Future Research Topics",
    "abstract": "The current study uses a systematic literature review to summarize and highlight studies on overconfidence bias in investment decision-making. More specifically, the study synthesizes the overconfidence literature highlighting the year of publication, country of the published articles, research methods, data sources, prominent theories, statistical techniques, citation analysis of the popular articles and authors and future research topics. The authors study 111 documents indexed in Scopus and/or Web of Science databases to recognize research trends regarding overconfidence bias during the last 29 years (1995–2023). The results indicate that most (61.26%) selected studies are empirical. Likewise, secondary data-based articles dominate primary ones. Additionally, the resulting factors can be classified into four themes: the construct of overconfidence bias and investments; success: a cause of overconfidence; gender and overconfidence; and the consequences of overconfidence. To the authors’ best knowledge, this is a unique article in which research outcomes of essential aspects of overconfidence are skimmed systematically. © 2023 Fortune Institute of International Business.",

    "title": "Fully 3D implementation of the end-to-end deep image prior-based PET image reconstruction using block iterative algorithm",
    "abstract": "Objective. Deep image prior (DIP) has recently attracted attention owing to its unsupervised positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction method, which does not require any prior training dataset. In this paper, we present the first attempt to implement an end-to-end DIP-based fully 3D PET image reconstruction method that incorporates a forward-projection model into a loss function. Approach. A practical implementation of a fully 3D PET image reconstruction could not be performed at present because of a graphics processing unit memory limitation. Consequently, we modify the DIP optimization to a block iteration and sequential learning of an ordered sequence of block sinograms. Furthermore, the relative difference penalty (RDP) term is added to the loss function to enhance the quantitative accuracy of the PET image. Main results. We evaluated our proposed method using Monte Carlo simulation with [18F]FDG PET data of a human brain and a preclinical study on monkey-brain [18F]FDG PET data. The proposed method was compared with the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization (EM), maximum a posteriori EM with RDP, and hybrid DIP-based PET reconstruction methods. The simulation results showed that, compared with other algorithms, the proposed method improved the PET image quality by reducing statistical noise and better preserved the contrast of brain structures and inserted tumors. In the preclinical experiment, finer structures and better contrast recovery were obtained with the proposed method. Significance. The results indicated that the proposed method could produce high-quality images without a prior training dataset. Thus, the proposed method could be a key enabling technology for the straightforward and practical implementation of end-to-end DIP-based fully 3D PET image reconstruction. © 2023 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",

    "abstract": "Multiphase flow metering is an open research field, with challenges encompassing sensor development and thermofluid models, for instance. Sparse regression is a modern system identification strategy able to provide simple models with Physical interpretation. This papers applies sparse identification for the assessment of gas velocity, gas fraction and superficial velocities of liquid and gas in experimental air–water horizontal slug flow across a Venturi tube and a twin-plane capacitive sensor. We show that this technique can improve measurement accuracies, as deviations for superficial velocities fall below 2.8% for liquid and 8.7% for gas. More importantly, the analysis of three data sets discusses practical concerns when applying sparse regression methods in metering, including the choice of basis functions, the degree of sparsity and overfitting. Overall, sparse identification is perceived as an adequate method to simultaneously generate a measurement model and correction of measurement biases in a specific measurement setup. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "title": "Diabetic retinopathy detection using EADBSC and improved dilated ensemble CNN-based classification",
    "abstract": "Nowadays high-rated and active research in the ophthalmic field has paved the way for the detection of several retinal disorders which helps the ophthalmologist, in scheduling and executing timely treatment. Due to more number of retinal defective patients and less number of medical professionals regular screening is one the most difficult tasks. The primary objective of this research work is to help doctors and other medical professionals predict the diabetic retinopathy. Here in this research article work retina fundus images are taken from the both Public dataset and the in-house clinical dataset from Chaithanya Eye Hospital Kerala. The first stage is to remove noise from the input image and enhance the contrast of the images. For noise reduction, a Bilateral Filter is utilized first, followed by enhancement utilizing Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization with an unsharp technique. Then Thick Blood vessels are segmented from the enhanced image using the Extended Adaptive Density-Based Spatial Clustering (EADBSC) Method. The segmented image is fed to the classifier such as Ensemble CNN & Improved dilated ensemble CNN classification, which classifies the image as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) or Normal case. Using Ensemble CNN, an accuracy of 97.46% is obtained. Improved dilated ensemble CNN-based classifier has an accuracy of 99.19%. By way of their efficiency estimation, the improved dilated ensemble CNN classifier is higher than most standard classifiers. It is also hoped that the developed automatic detection techniques will assist clinicians to diagnose Diabetic Retinopathy at an early stage. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "abstract": "Sensing technology is an important aspect of information processing. Current development in artificial intelligence systems (especially those aimed at medical and environmental applications) requires a lot of data on the chemical composition of biological fluids or environmental samples. These complex matrices require advanced sensing devices, and photoelectrochemical ones seem to have potential to overcome at least some of the obstacles. Furthermore, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology for autonomous robotics requires technology mimicking human senses, also those operating at the molecular level, such as gustation and olfaction. Again, photoelectrochemical sensing can provide some suitable solutions. In this review, we introduce the idea of integration of photoelectrochemical sensors with some unconventional computing paradigm – reservoir computing. This approach should not only boost the performance of the sensors itself, but also open new pathways through science. Integration of sensing devices with computing systems will also contribute to a better understanding (or at least mimicking) of the human senses and neuromorphic sensory information processing. Although reservoir systems can be considered magic “black boxes” and their operation is at the same time simple and hard to comprehend, this combination is expected to open a new era of effective information harvesting and processing systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

    "title": "HViT: Hybrid vision inspired transformer for the assessment of carotid artery plaque by addressing the cross-modality domain adaptation problem in MRI",
    "abstract": "Background: Medical image classification is crucial for accurate and efficient diagnosis, and deep learning frameworks have shown significant potential in this area. When a general learning deep model is directly deployed to a new dataset with heterogeneous features, the effect of domain shifts is usually ignored, which degrades the performance of deep learning models and leads to inaccurate predictions. Purpose: This study aims to propose a framework that utilized the cross-modality domain adaptation and accurately diagnose and classify MRI scans and domain knowledge into stable and vulnerable plaque categories by a modified Vision Transformer (ViT) model for the classification of MRI scans and transformer model for domain knowledge classification. Methods: This study proposes a Hybrid Vision Inspired Transformer (HViT) framework that employs a convolutional layer for image pre-processing and normalization and a 3D convolutional layer to enable ViT to classify 3D images. Our proposed HViT framework introduces a slim design with a multi-branch network and channel attention, improving patch embedding extraction and information learning. Auxiliary losses target shallow features, linking them with deeper ones, enhancing information gain, and model generalization. Furthermore, replacing the MLP Head with RNN enables better backpropagation for improved performance. Moreover, we utilized a modified transformer model with LSTM positional encoding and Golve word vector to classify domain knowledge. By using ensemble learning techniques, specifically stacking ensemble learning with hard and soft prediction, we combine the predictive power of both models to address the cross-modality domain adaptation problem and improve overall performance. Results: The proposed framework achieved an accuracy of 94.32% for carotid artery plaque classification into stable and vulnerable plaque by addressing the cross-modality domain adaptation problem and improving overall performance. Conclusion: The model was further evaluated using an independent dataset acquired from different hardware protocols. The results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning model significantly improves the generalization ability across different MRI scans acquired from different hardware protocols without requiring additional calibration data. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of autofluorescent waste products, amyloids, and products of lipid peroxidation (LPO) are important hallmarks of aging. Until now, these processes have not been documented in Daphnia, a convenient model organism for longevity and senescence studies. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of autofluorescence and Congo Red (CR) fluorescent staining for amyloids in four clones of D. magna. Additionally, we used a single time point cross-sectional common garden experiment within a single clone in which autofluorescence and BODIPY C11 fluorescence were measured. We observed a robust increase in autofluorescent spots that show diagnostic co-staining by Sudan Black indicating lipofuscin aggregates, particularly in the upper body region. There was also a significant clone-by-age interaction indicating that some genotypes accumulated lipofuscins faster than others. Contrary to predictions, CR fluorescence and lipid peroxidation did not consistently increase with age. CR fluorescence demonstrated a slight non-monotonous relationship with age, achieving the highest values at intermediate ages, possibly due to elimination of physiological heterogeneity in our genetically uniform cohorts. LPO demonstrated a significant ovary status-by-age interaction, decreasing with age when measured in Daphnia with full ovaries (late phase ovarian cycle) and showing no significant trend or slight increase with age when measured during the early phase in the ovarian cycle. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

However, a breast cancer diagnosis is complicated, requiring biopsy by various methods, such as MRI, ultrasound, BI-RADS, or even needle aspiration and cytology with the suggestions of specialists. On certain occasions, such as body examinations of a large number of people, it is also a large workload to check the images. Therefore, in this work, we present an efficient and automatic diagnosis system based on the hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) for breast cancer ultrasound results with high efficiency and make a primary diagnosis of the images. To make it compatible to use, this system consists of PNG images and general medical software within the H-ELM framework, which is easily trained and applied. Furthermore, this system only requires ultrasound images on a small scale, of (Formula presented.) pixels, reducing the resources and fulfilling the application with low-resolution images. The experimental results show that the system can achieve 86.13% in the classification of breast cancer based on ultrasound images from the public breast ultrasound images (BUSI) dataset, without other relative information and supervision, which is higher than the conventional deep learning methods on the same dataset. Moreover, the training time is highly reduced, to only 5.31 s, and consumes few resources. The experimental results indicate that this system could be helpful for precise and efficient early diagnosis of breast cancers with primary examination results. © 2023 by the authors.",

    "title": "Superior effects of hybrid laser shock peening and ultrasonic nanocrystalline surface modification on fatigue behavior of additive manufactured AlSi10Mg",
    "abstract": "The surface texture of metallic parts produced by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) in the as-built condition detrimentally affects their mechanical properties, especially fatigue behavior. Accordingly, applying surface post-treatments has become an attractive approach to improve the mechanical performance of these materials. In the present study, both the individual and combined effects of post-processing methods, i.e., laser shock peening (LSP) and ultrasonic nanocrystalline surface modification (UNSM) with the same intensity of 10–12 A [0.001 in.], were systematically investigated on mechanical properties and fatigue behavior of L-PBF AlSi10Mg specimens. A wide range of experiments involving microstructural characterization, hardness and residual stresses measurements, porosity and surface texture analyses, tensile tests, and rotating bending fatigue tests were conducted. The results revealed that the hybrid LSP + UNSM process resulted in significant improvement in mechanical properties and fatigue behavior due to (i) sub-surface pores closure up to the depth of 517 μm, (ii) 60 % surface hardness improvement, (iii) inducing −420 MPa surface compressive residual stresses, and (iv) surface roughness reduction up to 70 %. The fatigue life was improved up to 75, 56, and 35-fold compared to the as-built state after applying LSP + UNSM, UNSM, and LSP treatments, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

    "title": "Optimization of enhanced oil recovery using ASP solution",
    "abstract": "Many studies have been conducted to focused on developing an optimal alkali/surfactant/polymer (ASP) composition to increase the recovered fraction of oil in reservoirs that have already undergone water injection. To analyze the effect of alkali (Na2CO3), surfactant (lauryl sodium sulfate), and polymer (commercial xanthan gum) concentration on oil recovery, a complete factorial experimental design was performed with combinations of three variables (alkali, surfactant, and polymer) and three central point replications (2³ + 3). The experiments were carried out on a core holder using rock samples from the Botucatu formation. The simulated oil reservoirs have an average permeability of 348 mD and a temperature of 60 °C. The crude oil was acquired from the Carmópolis field, with 25.72 °API. Synthetic production water containing 40,000 mg L−1 of NaCl and 13,000 mg L−1 of Na2SO4 was injected through an HPLC pump to saturate the rock samples and to recover the oil in the secondary step. From the experimental results, it was verified that the surfactant and polymer concentrations are the most statistically significant independent variables and that first-order interactions are not statistically significant for the process. The oil recovery factors in the secondary stage ranged between 30 and 36 % of the OOIP, which are within the range reported in the literature. The optimal composition of the ASP fluid obtained a recovered fraction of oil of 62 % in the advanced step. Other combinations reported in the literature used higher concentrations of alkali, surfactant, and polymer with lower recoveries and higher cost in the injection design. Thus, the present study highlights the necessity to investigate the performance of each component of the ASP solution. In addition, the results obtained in this study are very attractive for possible full-scale applications. © 2023 The Authors",

    "abstract": "Cardiac MR imaging is well established for assessment of cardiovascular structure and function, myocardial scar, quantitative flow, parametric mapping, and myocardial perfusion. Despite the clear evidence supporting the use of cardiac MRI for a wide range of indications, it is underutilized clinically. Recent developments in low-field MRI technology, including modern data acquisition and image reconstruction methods, are enabling high-quality low-field imaging that may improve the cost–benefit ratio for cardiac MRI. Studies to-date confirm that low-field MRI offers high measurement concordance and consistent interpretation with clinical imaging for several routine sequences. Moreover, low-field MRI may enable specific new clinical opportunities for cardiac imaging such as imaging near metal implants, MRI-guided interventions, combined cardiopulmonary assessment, and imaging of patients with severe obesity. In this review, we discuss the recent progress in low-field cardiac MRI with a focus on technical developments and early clinical validation studies. Evidence Level: 5.

    "title": "Multi-modal interaction using time division long-term evolution (TD-LTE) for space designing exhibition",
    "abstract": "The pavilion combines multi-modal interaction based on Time-Division Long Term Evolution (TD-LTE) to increase the exhibition's interactivity and attractiveness with development of digital technology. Multi-modal interaction enables consumers to engage easily and intuitively with exhibitions or display material with the use of a touch screen, voice recognition, posture detection, and other interactive tools for immersive displays. This paper investigates the construction of a multi-modal interactive exhibition space using digital media technology. In contrast to the usual data collection techniques, which are costly, deficient in 3D pictures, suffer from a lack of spatial position data, and have other drawbacks, key techniques such as deep learning and posture estimation employed in immersive displays sometimes require huge training datasets to enhance the generality of the models. A 6D network architecture for target object estimation is proposed in this research to lower the cost of data collection. The interactive experience of visitors in the exhibition space, exhibit display, and exhibition space management can be improved by multi-modal interaction based on TD-LTE. Visitors can peruse exhibit material, watch movies, and play interactive games more freely due to the engagement modes. Exhibition managers may optimize the layout of the exhibition space and the placement of the exhibits through real-time monitoring, data collection, and analysis. The multi-mode interaction mode based on TD-LTE wireless communication technology can give visitors a rich and more user-friendly exhibition experience with a wide range of application prospects and potentials. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

    "abstract": "The computing continuum is growing because multiple devices are added daily. Edge devices play a key role in this because computation is decentralized or distributed. Edge computing is advanced by using AI/ML algorithms to become more intelligent. Besides, Edge data protocols are useful for transmitting or receiving data between devices. Since, computation efficiency is possible when the data is received at the Edge timely, and it is possible only when the data protocols are efficient, reliable and fast. Most edge data protocols are defined with static set of rules and their primary purpose is to provide standardized and reliable data communications. Edge devices need autonomous or dynamic protocols that enable interoperability, autonomous decision making, scalability, and adaptability. This paper examines the limitations of popular data protocols used in edge networks, the need for intelligent data protocols, and their implications. We also explore possible ways to simplify learning for edge devices and discuss how intelligent data protocols can mitigate challenges such as congestion, message filtering, message expiration, prioritization, and resource handling. © 2023 IEEE.",

    "abstract": "Background: To investigate the potential of radiomic features and dual-source dual-energy CT (DECT) parameters in differentiating between benign and malignant mediastinal masses and predicting patient outcomes. Methods: In this retrospective study, we analysed data from 90 patients (38 females, mean age 51 ± 25 years) with confirmed mediastinal masses who underwent contrast-enhanced DECT. Attenuation, radiomic features and DECT-derived imaging parameters were evaluated by two experienced readers. We performed analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-square statistic tests for data comparison. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and Cox regression tests were used to differentiate between mediastinal masses. Results: Of the 90 mediastinal masses, 49 (54%) were benign, including cases of thymic hyperplasia/thymic rebound (n = 10), mediastinitis (n = 16) and thymoma (n = 23). The remaining 41 (46%) lesions were classified as malignant, consisting of lymphoma (n = 28), mediastinal tumour (n = 4) and thymic carcinoma (n = 9). Significant differences were observed between benign and malignant mediastinal masses in all DECT-derived parameters (p ≤.001) and 38 radiomic features (p ≤.044) obtained from contrast-enhanced DECT. The combination of these methods achieved an area under the curve of.98 (95% CI,.893–1.000; p <.001) to differentiate between benign and malignant masses, with 100% sensitivity and 91% specificity. Throughout a follow-up of 1800 days, a multiparametric model incorporating radiomic features, DECT parameters and gender showed promising prognostic power in predicting all-cause mortality (c-index =.8 [95% CI,.702–.890], p <.001). Conclusions: A multiparametric approach combining radiomic features and DECT-derived imaging biomarkers allows for accurate and noninvasive differentiation between benign and malignant masses in the anterior mediastinum. © 2023 The Authors.

    "title": "Predictive models of long COVID",
    "abstract": "Background: The cause and symptoms of long COVID are poorly understood. It is challenging to predict whether a given COVID-19 patient will develop long COVID in the future. Methods: We used electronic health record (EHR) data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative to predict the incidence of long COVID. We trained two machine learning (ML) models — logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF). Features used to train predictors included symptoms and drugs ordered during acute infection, measures of COVID-19 treatment, pre-COVID comorbidities, and demographic information. We assigned the ‘long COVID’ label to patients diagnosed with the U09.9 ICD10-CM code. The cohorts included patients with (a) EHRs reported from data partners using U09.9 ICD10-CM code and (b) at least one EHR in each feature category. We analysed three cohorts: all patients (n = 2,190,579; diagnosed with long COVID = 17,036), inpatients (149,319; 3,295), and outpatients (2,041,260; 13,741). Findings: LR and RF models yielded median AUROC of 0.76 and 0.75, respectively. Ablation study revealed that drugs had the highest influence on the prediction task. The SHAP method identified age, gender, cough, fatigue, albuterol, obesity, diabetes, and chronic lung disease as explanatory features. Models trained on data from one N3C partner and tested on data from the other partners had average AUROC of 0.75. Interpretation: ML-based classification using EHR information from the acute infection period is effective in predicting long COVID. SHAP methods identified important features for prediction. Cross-site analysis demonstrated the generalizability of the proposed methodology.

    "abstract": "The song recommendation model is a powerful tool for improving user experience and engagement with streaming music services. Depending on user emotion recognition, the proposed Song suggester Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed model uses facial expressions to recognize the user's emotions, which are then used to recommend songs that match their mood. The model is trained on a large dataset of facial expressions and songs with emotional labels. The facial expression images are pre-processed using various image augmentation techniques and then fed into the CNN model for feature extraction. The extracted features are then used to predict the user's emotions, which are mapped to the corresponding emotional labels of songs. The recommended songs are then presented to the user, who can choose to add them to their playlist. The proposed model outperforms existing emotion-based song recommendation models and has the potential to enhance user experience in music streaming services with an accuracy of 93%. © 2023 IEEE.",

    "title": "Broadband Achromatic Metalens for Tunable Focused Vortex Beam Generation in the Near-Infrared Range",
    "abstract": "Vortex beams accompanied with orbital angular momentum have attracted significant attention in research fields due to their formidable capabilities in various crucial applications. However, conventional devices for generating vortex beams still suffer from bulky sizes, high cost, and confined performances. Metalens, as an advanced platform to arbitrarily control the optical waves, has promising prospects to address the predicament for conventional devices. Although great progress has been demonstrated in the applications of vortex beams, they are still confronted with fixed functionality after fabrication that severely hinders their application range. In this work, the phase-change material of Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) is employed to design the meta-atoms to realize tunable optical responses. Moreover, the focused vortex beam can be accomplished by superimposing a helical phase and hyperbolic phase, and the chromatic aberrations in near-infrared (NIR) range can be corrected by introducing an additional phase compensation. And the design strategy is validated by two different metalenses (BAMTF-1 and BAMTF-2). The numerical results indicate that the chromatic aberrations for two metalens can be corrected in 1.33–1.60 μm covering the telecom range. Moreover, the average focusing efficiency of BAMTF-1 is 51.4%, and that of BAMTF-2 is 39.9%, indicating the favorable performances of designed BAMTF. More importantly, their average focal lengths have a relative tuning range of 38.82% and 33.17% by altering the crystallization ratio of GST, respectively. This work may provide a significant scheme for on-chip and tunable devices for NIR imaging and communication systems. © 2023 by the authors.",

    "title": "Operational strategy and capacity optimization of standalone solar-wind-biomass-fuel cell energy system using hybrid LF-SSA algorithms",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for the efficient design and evaluation of a standalone hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) to meet the energy requirements of a rural community in the north-eastern region of Nigeria. The proposed microgrid system incorporates solar photovoltaic, wind turbines, biomass gasifier, fuel cell, and Battery storage. The sizing of each component is determined through the utilization of real local meteorological data and the load demand over a year, employing the Levy flight-salp swarm algorithms (LF-SSA). The optimization objective is to minimize the annualized system cost (ASC) of the HRES, while also considering the reliability constraint of Loss of power supply probability (LPSP). The comparative outcomes demonstrate that the LF-SSA surpasses other examined algorithms, namely the salp swarm, genetic algorithm, and HOMER software by achieving substantial cost savings of $29033, $50796, $191771 respectively in relation to the proposed HRES. The result further shows that, the LF-SSA provides the lowest LCOE of $0.933162/kWh, in contrast to SSA at $0.947737/kWh, GA at $0.958660/kWh, and HOMER at $1.075351/kWh. Additionally, the results indicate that the implemented Energy Management System (EMS) has successfully facilitated the establishment of an environmentally friendly and cost-effective energy system. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",

    "title": "Modeling Approaches for Residential Energy Consumption: A Literature Review",
    "abstract": "The interest in sustainability and energy efficiency is constantly increasing, and the noticeable effects of climate change and rising energy prices are fueling this development. The residential sector is one of the most energy-intensive sectors and plays an important role in shaping future energy consumption. In this context, modeling has been extensively employed to identify relative key drivers, and to evaluate the impact of different strategies to reduce energy consumption and emissions. This article presents a detailed literature review relative to modeling approaches and techniques in residential energy use, including case studies to assess and predict the energy consumption patterns of the sector. The purpose of this article is not only to review the research to date in this field, but to also identify the possible challenges and opportunities. Mobility, electrical devices, cooling and heating systems, and energy storage and energy production technologies will be the subject of the presented research. Furthermore, the energy upgrades of buildings, their energy classification, as well as the energy labels of the electric appliances will be discussed. Previous research provided valuable insights into the application of modeling techniques to address the complexities of residential energy consumption. This paper offers a thorough resource for researchers, stakeholders, and other parties interested in promoting sustainable energy practices. The information gathered can contribute to the development of effective strategies for reducing energy use, facilitating energy-efficient renovations, and helping to promote a greener and more sustainable future in the residential domain. © 2023 by the authors.",

    "title": "Using machine learning for image-based analysis of sweetpotato root sensory attributes",
    "abstract": "The sweetpotato breeding process involves assessing different phenotypic traits, such as the sensory attributes, to decide which varieties to progress to the next stage during the breeding cycle. Sensory attributes like appearance, taste, colour and mealiness are important for consumer acceptability and adoption of new varieties. Therefore, measuring these sensory attributes is critical to inform the selection of varieties during breeding. Current methods using a trained human panel enable screening of different sweetpotato sensory attributes. Despite this, such methods are costly and time-consuming, leading to low throughput, which remains the biggest challenge for breeders. In this paper, we describe an approach to apply machine learning techniques with image-based analysis to predict flesh-colour and mealiness sweetpotato sensory attributes. The developed models can be used as high-throughput methods to augment existing approaches for the evaluation of flesh-colour and mealiness for different sweetpotato varieties. The work involved capturing images of boiled sweetpotato cross-sections using the DigiEye imaging system, data pre-processing for background elimination and feature extraction to develop machine learning models to predict the flesh-colour and mealiness sensory attributes of different sweetpotato varieties. For flesh-colour the trained Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models attained R2 values of 0.92 and 0.87, respectively, against the ground truth values given by a human sensory panel. In contrast, the Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting model attained R2 values of 0.85 and 0.80, respectively, for the prediction of mealiness. The performance of the models matched the desirable R2 threshold of 0.80 for acceptable comparability to the human sensory panel showing that this approach can be used for the prediction of these attributes with high accuracy. The machine learning models were deployed and tested by the sweetpotato breeding team at the International Potato Center in Uganda. This solution can automate and increase throughput for analysing flesh-colour and mealiness sweetpotato sensory attributes. Using machine learning tools for analysis can inform and quicken the selection of promising varieties that can be progressed for participatory evaluation during breeding cycles and potentially lead to increased chances of adoption of the varieties by consumers. © 2023 The Author(s)",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of disability and death in both women and men; considerable differences in clinical presentation, natural history and prognosis are reported between sexes. Different pathophysiological mechanisms play a major role, including sex-related and gender-related features or a combination of both. Reports from intracoronary imaging studies pointed towards morphological plaque features, which seemed to differ between men and women, albeit results reported so far were not conclusive. The purpose of this review is to shed light on differences in the pathophysiology underlying CAD in women vs men including the description of coronary plaque phenotype and mechanisms of plaque instability, as assessed by intracoronary imaging. We will also discuss potential clinical implications with the aim to move towards a sex and gender-based personalized approach in CAD patients. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",

    "title": "An IoT based environment conscious green score meter towards smart sustainable cities",
    "abstract": "In today's modern world, use of natural resources is expanding certainly because of the refined lifestyle of the individuals. The unjustifiable use of these non-renewable resources can affect the stability between environmental and biological diversity which leads to greenhouse effect. This situation requires awareness and motivation to encourage people towards sustainable energy use and conservation in order to reduce global warming. For effective implementation, government initiatives require a systematic public participation to assess household's level of energy self-sustainability and reward accordingly. On this regard, we introduce an IoT powered green architecture to assign an optimal green score to a household by assessing the households’ level of energy self-sustainability using a novel green score algorithm based green score meter. The green score algorithm will results high green score rating to a household with high renewable energy production than the non-renewable energy consumption with less air contamination. Based the household energy data, the green score meter computes the green score rating of a household using the green score algorithm and forward the score to the authorized third party like cloud server for green rank calculation and virtual display. Here, we present a tax exemption scheme which benefits the households with high green score rating. The existing frameworks (HEMS, iCHEMS, SHEMS) monitor and aware the user/household for efficient energy management, cost management but in contrast our proposed green architecture is an integrated platform for collective energy management to evaluate energy self-sustainability of the household, so as to give financial incentives. Thus, our proposed green score based tax exemption scheme will appreciate and urge the residents to burn-through less natural assets and forestall less contamination. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",
